t3_4fpdmh,4,Overstayed for less than 180 days on F1. Now applying for new F1. Problem?,2016-04-20 20:28:47,"I was on an F1 student visa from 2010-15 and graduated in May 2015; visa expired on July 2015. Due to a bit of confusion between me and the school, my application for OPT was delayed, and the school refused to accept as it would have been eventually denied by USCIS. This revelation came in July 2015 and I was told that I would have to leave the country immediately and reapply. Since I was not expecting this transition, I voluntarily left in August 2015, after taking care of a few things, without any notice or deportation threat. Now I am all set to apply for another F1 student visa for graduate school from my country of origin. Will the short overstay be a problem in getting a fresh visa?"

1.) Incidental to your primary purpose of study
2.) Less than full-time
3.) Should be avocational or recreational in nature (no certificate or degree programs)

If you decide to study on a tourist visa please make sure you first discuss legal issues with an international student advisor on the campus you will attend."

t3_4l4iug,4,F-1 Student Visa Question,2016-05-26 09:32:48,"I have withdrawn from UC Berkeley and the International Office has, therefore, terminated by I-20. I plan to take one semester at another college, from which I received a new I-20. Do I also have to get a new F-1 Visa from US Embassy in my home country in order to re-enter the country? Or can I use the one I already have(far from expiration date) for re-entry?"
t3_4n6fti,0,"FAQs: Financial Aid, paying for tuition, working in the U.S",2016-06-08 18:09:41,"When I was an International Student, finding accurate information was challenging and I typically received multiple different answers for the same question. Later on, while working at the International Students Department at my college, I realized that the questions I had were the same that everyone else had; but finding the information wasn’t easy. I decided to put together this quick list of a few of those questions to help others international students (F1 visa) in the US. 

A) What is FAFSA? 
Free Application for Federal Student Aid or FAFSA (https://fafsa.ed.gov/) is the website through which eligible students can apply for Federal Aid to cover the costs of college and/or career costs. 


B) As an International Student, can I apply for Federal Aid? 
No. Only U.S. Citizens or eligible non-citizens can apply for Federal Aid. Eligible non-citizens include permanent residents, refugees, and asylees, among others. For more details on “eligible non-citizens” please visit the “Many non-U.S. citizens qualify for federal student aid” page on the FAFSA website (https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/eligibility/non-us-citizens)


C) The tuition is expensive, how can I pay for it?
For International Students, covering the costs of tuition can be challenging. A few options are: 

-Scholarships and Grants: websites such as the International Financial Aid College Scholarship Search (http://www.iefa.org/) and International Scholarships (internationalscholarships.com) provide tons of information on scholarships and grants available to International Students.

-Funding offered Colleges and Universities: most of the colleges and universities offer Fellowships, Grants and/or Scholarships that are open to international students. Each institution is different. For example while completing my Associates Degree I obtained grants for being a member of the Student Government Association, The Honors Society as well as awards for doing community service. These did not cover the whole tuition but they definitely helped. The International Students and the Student Life Department at the college you plan on attending are a good place to ask about these options. For my BA I was able to obtain a merit scholarship at a private College, which covered 80% of my tuition and fees. 
When I was applying to Universities to complete my Bachelors, I encountered many more Private institutions that offered financial help for International Students than Public ones. However, I don’t know if this is the case for all Private universities. 

-Private Loans: banks such as Sallie Mae provide educational loans for International Students. However, in order to apply you will need a cosigner who is a permanent resident or a U.S. citizen. This requirement may sound strange, but this is how Banks make sure that the loan will be repaid.  From the Bank’s perspective International Students do not have any ties to this country, and could leave at any time without repaying the loan. This is also the reason why, if possible, the cosigner should have a good credit score. A cosigner with a good credit score, typically means less risk and a lower interest rate. 

-Be aware of the cost of tuition up front. Some community colleges are very affordable. See if you can fit their tuition into your budget, but if not don’t be discouraged. As I mentioned, many colleges and universities that have tuition rates that may seem out of reach offer scholarships or grants. 


D) Can I work as an International Student? 
International Students are only allowed to work at the college where they attend. Typically these jobs do not cover tuition costs, but once again, they help. The International Students Department at your college, would be a good place to find information about these jobs. 

Hope this helps!"

I would like some insight and possibly chat with someone who has been through the process.

I'm a nervous and anxious person, so, the interview with the immigration department is something that I really want to get ready for. 

Some of my questions are:

1) What would happen to my current tourist visa if case they deny the F1?

2) Overall, how do officers treat you in the interview? I remember since I was a kid they were pretty harsh on the interview for the tourist visa, would like to know if it's the same way when applying for the F1 so I can be prepared.

3) I know the College I'm applying for is going to ask me for the paper work (affidavit of support from my sponsors, bank account statement, etc.) are these papers that I need to bring for the interview too? Does the interview with the officers requires me to bring any extra documentation for them to see?

Anyways. If any of you guys have any tips or would just share your experience, I would really appreciate it. I've read about the possible questions they ask and know about all the requirements, however I want to be 100% prepared, and talking to someone just to see how the whole thing goes would really help me.

I am a F1 sudent, came to the US from Mexico. I start classes in two days.


I first entered the US a couple weeks ago (I crossed the border by car), then, last week I went to school because they needed to register my paperwork, and I was not aware that I did not get my passport stamped (I didn't know I had to either so I didn't check when I entered).

My International Student Services counselors checked online and there was no record of the passport stamping electronically either.


My counselor told me I could still go to school and it was not a big deal, but I needed to get it stamped before I attempt to make any DMV tramit.

Since I'm not far from home, it only takes me a few hours to drive there and come back the same day. However I have NOT been able to do so.

I asked my counselor if I should go before classes started and he told me not to worry if I couldn't, since it was not my fault, that I can still go to school but next time I travel to Mexico (maybe in two weeks) I make sure I get my passport stamped or ask the officers for an I-94 permit.

However I'm worried because even if he said I could still attend school I don't want it to cause me any trouble in the future (especially now that things are getting difficult for non-immigrant visa holders).

Can anyone give me insight on this matter?"

2 questions:

The US allows non-US spec cars to enter for up to 365 days... is the US like Europe where you can leave and re-enter and you get another 6 months (in this case 12)? Also, say I got an approval to import my car on January 1st 2017 for 365 days... can I come and go to Canada as many times as I like without getting an approval every time until January 1st 2018? Or, do I need a new approval every time? 

If I ship my car to Canada first and enter as a tourist, do I then not need to get prior approval? If I am studying for several years in the US, and am not a resident, what are my options?

Also, if I am entering the US **before getting an F1 visa** as a tourist, from Canada, do I need to do an ESTA? I hear that Canadians can just ""come and go"" to the US, but I am sure they only get 90 days out of 180 like us Brits? 

Does their time reset with every return to Canada? Does the ESTA 90 days only apply to those arriving by plane from Asia/Europe/South America?

I am required to complete a mandatory unpaid internship to graduate but I am having trouble finding an internship that will take me. Currently I do not have a SSN as it can not be applied for until 30 before the start of your CPT (internship). Due to the nature of these internships I require background clearance, which requires a SSN. I was offered an internship at a sheriffs office, however it was rescinded because I do not have a SSN ( even though I offered my Canadian SIN, Passport and license information) and they were not willing to wait for December when I get a SSN to run the background on me. Seeing as I had to do a Biometrics and background just to enter the country , I find this all very frustrating because a background for my time in the US would only show the ten months I have been here ( I am a transfer student), and had I done anything illegal my visa would likely have been void and I would not be here. Have any students matched to internships and had backgrounds done without SSN? My international office on campus seems to be fairly oblivious to this process. Thanks!"

Apologies if this is in the wrong sub or if you know of one that is better suited.

I'm currently an F1 student and have been in a long term relationship for just over two and a half years. She is American and I wanted to see if anyone had any input on this.

I proposed earlier this year and wanted to know if I can actually do it currently under my F1 status?

The visa itself in my passport expired Jan 7th but my I-20 is valid all the way til December.

I did some research and from my understanding, there is no legal issue with my passport visa being outdated, so long as my I-20 is still valid.

Aside from that, am I legally allowed to marry her whilst on an F1 visa?

I looked around a bit and it sounded as if I am legally allowed to do it but wasn't sure if there is any conditions I must satisfy before getting married. 

For example, do I need a blood or drug test?

From what I understood, we were good to get married whenever we felt like and following that, I would be able to file papers for a Green Card and an adjustment of status.

Any information would be greatly appreciated."

I am applying for an F1 for graduate school and currently physically present in the US (finishing up another visa) until early next week. In my DS-160 it asked me if I would travel to my home country from another country to obtain my visa, which I answered no to.

Now the part I would love your input on: the SEVIS application asks me to click on all those that apply. It asks ""Are you physically present in [home country])."" Though I am currently not, I will be in a  matter of days and will be applying for the visa in my hometown's embassy.

I worry that if I state that I am not physically present in my home-country, it will contradict my DS160 application. So, should I click that I am in my home country, as I will be at the time of my application.

I worry I am overthinking it. What do you think? Any and all help is greatly appreciated! I thank you so much."

If I know that an OPT application will be denied because it wasn't submitted within 30 days of the DSO creating the OPT recommendation I-20, is it possible to submit another OPT application for the same student while the first one is in pending or requested status and USCIS has not denied the first one yet? At this time, the Lockbox has received it, but USCIS has not quite received the application yet. I know that you would still need to submit another OPT application within the application window (within 90 days before graduation or within 60 days after graduation)... but could the same person submit another one before USCIS has done anything with the first one yet?

,3,Received my OPT while outside the USA.,2018-06-17 03:36:42,"Hello,

I filed my OPT in march. I already knew I could not be in the US to receive the OPT. I put the address of my roommate and the card already arrived. 

However my biggest worry here is entering the US. I am aware that it is risky but my ticket was already bought before the OPT application, I had to come home to solve an inquiry with my citizenship card and staying in the US during the summer was a very bad shot because I would be stuck not doing much. Internships were not really an option since I was not authorized (I just graduated and could not link it to my school credits). Given all these circusmtances, I came home and plan on leaving on july when OPT starts. I know reasons are irrelevant and if I tell this to inmigration they will not care.

The point is that I have to talk to my university about this like I did before. They told me to print in USCIS the proof that I requested it. Anything else I have to consider doing to show transparently that I have applied for OPT, that I have been approved and I am still looking for a job? 

Thanks!"

,15,OPT processing time,2018-07-04 04:01:55,"Hi,

Does it usually take the full 90 days for USCIS to process your OPT? They recieved mine on around April 19th (74 days ago), and I haven't heard anything since the I797C (receipt of notice) which I recieved in early May. 

Don't have a receipt of approval yet which you're supposed to get before the EAD card? Slightly worried. 


Also I need my EAD card soon because I just passed my drivers test and need to get my license within 30(or 60) days I believe. Should I go to my international office to make an inquiry or something?"

If so, will it affect my OPT status once I graduate from college, which is a month from now ?"
,3,Avoiding the 90 day unemployment rule?,2018-07-08 12:47:48,"Hi all, my OPT starts soon. However I have a couple of questions. It says as a rule that I can’t be unemployed for 90 days because I am going to lose my status. How do I avoid this? I was thinking about volunteering while I am doing my job search. But if I do volunteering, how does that exactly work? Does the company I am volunteering with have to report that to USCIS? How does volunteering exactly work on OPT standards?

Also, I have found a company that says they do not work with OPT holders because they are not registered to USCIS. Is this actually true and possible or do they just not want to work with OPT workers? In other words, is it possible a company denies you because you are on OPT and they are not on USCIS? If so, the job hunt will be much harder than it already is. 

Hope you are able to answer this doubt of mine.
Thanks!"

,0,Can Students On OPT Travel Internationally?,2018-08-27 23:19:59,"https://i.redd.it/2klkvilnypi11.jpg

**With the uncertainties surrounding visa requirements and the ever changing polices issued by United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), several travelers to the US are unsure of what to expect at each turn of a visa application process. Be it H1-B, work related visas or B2, visitor visas, the requirements for visa interviews and at the Port of Entry in airports has often become a stress point. International students coming on F-1 visas are another sub-section of this incoming traveler group that cannot afford to risk an error in the required process.**

**Below we have decoded the many scenarios wherein a student may have to travel while on Optional Practical Training (OPT). If you are an F-1 student who has applied for or working on OPT you must be aware of the risks of traveling internationally. While F-1 guidelines allow students on OPT to travel abroad there are additional protocols to follow.**

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/aqlr3jtkypi11.png

#### Things to know when traveling on OPT

* **An F-1 student who is on post-completion OPT and plans to travel outside the US can be re-admitted to resume employment for the remainder of the period as indicated on the EAD.**
* **Carry evidence proving how employment relates to his/her field of study or degree.**
* **An employment letter is required which states that the student will be resuming employment on return. This should specify dates and all details of leave of absence from work.**
* **USCIS recommends that an F-1 student should retain all documents that reflect dates of employment, proof of duration, job titles and descriptions, and contact information of the employer.**
* **Students on OPT are discouraged from leaving the U.S. until the petition has been issued by USCIS and the student has received an I-797 receipt notice.**
* **Students should also consult and notify the International Student and Scholar Services (ISSS) department of their school prior to traveling.**
* **Carry current SEVIS form I-20 with the latest signatures (within 6 months) of your ISSS advisor on the I-20.**

**To be noted that the above act as essential guidelines, students on OPT should travel at their own risk. The final decision is taken at the port of entry and the U.S. Custom and Border Protection officers may admit or deny admission based on their evaluation and discretion.**"

I was recently accepted into grad school in the US and I'm waiting on the documents to apply for an I-20.  It's been four years since I applied for my undergrad I-20 but I was all set up with a dorm so there wasn't really an issue with regards to housing. With that said, my boyfriend is asking if I wanted to move in with him. His parents own the house he's using (not his family home) and basically, I would be renting out one of the rooms. Would this pose as an issue when applying for the I-20?

I don't mind finding another place to rent out but it would be difficult for me to find and rent an apartment without having gone there prior. Other options include: Taking up someone's sublease or trying for a dorm; however, I know that graduate students aren't usually secured a spot for on-campus housing.

First, since I paid my SEVIS a month or so ago, I do not remember even putting a Username or a password. When I go back to the SEVIS webpage, they just want my SEVIS ID, my date of birth and my last name, so I don't find anywhere I can check for the e-mail I might have used. So I go to the ""forgot password"" and try all my various e-mails, to no avail.  

I then thought, maybe there is a mistake, and try to create a new account, but it won't let me. Maybe it's due to my hyphen, but they state ""the name exactly as in your passport"", which does include the hyphen.

,14,F-1 Administrative Processing during Government Shutdown,2019-01-07 20:39:46,"Hi,

**tldr;** Is there anyone who managed to get an F-1 visa after being put on administrative processing during the US government shutdown? If so, how long did it take? Alternatively, do you know anything about the administrative processing, in particular, whether the government shutdown affects that at all? Is there anything I could do the expedite the process and/or get an estimate for how long it would take?

&amp;#x200B;

**Full story, my situation:**

After graduating from college last year, I worked at a job for a few months and then started a PhD program (got I-20 via SEVIS transfer and hadn't left the US). I came back home for the winter break and applied for F-1 visa with the I-20 issued by my PhD institution. At the interview (Dec 27), I was told that my interview was approved. The pamphlet they gave me says ""you will receive your passport in 5-7 days"" and I went home, feeling peaceful.

It has been 10+ days now. Apparently I have been put on ""Administrative Processing"" (was not told this during the interview). I am not entirely sure why this happened but I guess it could be because my degree is technology-related. Although it is not listed in the TAL list (), there are a few degrees listed there close to my field. I asked whether I needed to provide any additional documents and I was told no, at least not for now.

What I am worrying about is this: will the government shutdown affect administrative processing? When I called the embassy, I was told: ""1) Visa processing will continue during the shutdown because they operate with application fees 2) Once an application is selected for administrative processing, we need to wait for that to complete 3) There is nothing they can do about the administrative processing since it is not done by the embassy"". But if it is not the embassy, I am guessing it is some U.S. government agency that carries out the administrative processing. Since only the essential branches operate during the government shutdown, I am wondering if this means the administrative processing will simply not take place until the shutdown is resolved and my visa process will keep getting delayed and delayed until I cannot attend the school until next fall or something (since Trump said shutdown could take months).

Is there no way to know whether administrative processing is actually going on or not? Is there any way to expedite the process? Also, is there anyone who was in my situation but got the visa (proving shutdown doesnt really affect it much)?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks a lot in advance!

&amp;#x200B;

**EDIT:** For future reference, my visa got issued today (01.11.2019, yaay!!) so it took about 2 weeks after the interview. It looks like government shutdown did not affect administrative processing in visa applications. Thanks to everyone who replied!"

,8,Any Advice Would Be Welcome,2019-01-21 14:28:55,"In June 2016, I got issued an F1 visa on a 50% scholarship to study Biochemistry at a liberal arts college. Like most 4-year schools, I did not have to declare a major until the end of sophomore year. I never declared a major but my goal at that time was to complete a Biochem pre-med track. At the end of my freshman year, I realized that as an international student medical school was too expensive a goal to attain given the lack of access to loans of any kind and the inflated cost of even state medical schools. So, I transferred with a 3.7 and on good academic standing from the school for which I was issued the visa in 2016 to a community college in a state where I had an uncle with a Phd who was also an international student but had for the last six years been a full time employee as an engineer in a hospital. I don't know for sure whether it's just a h1b visa or a green card that my uncle has.  At the community college, my major was mechanical engineering. Before starting at the community college, I came back home to spend the summer with my family at the end of freshman year. I returned and continued my education at the community college. At the community college, I maintained full time status from August 2017 through December 2018 attending summer classes, coming home twice during that period, and re-entering on my new I-20 and original visa each time I had to.   


Here is where I truly need advice. In November 2018, with 16 credit hours left to obtain an AS in mechanical engineering at the community college, I got admitted into a four year university within the same state as the community college. I accepted the admission on scholarship given that I had a 4.0 at the community college.  This four year university, unlike the community college ,which operates on a semester system, operates on a quarter system.  My admission was for the Spring 19 quarter. I left the US for Christmas break on the 11th of December. While home, I got in touch with the community college's ISO and requested that she transferred my SEVIS ID to the four year school. A request she promptly granted.  Upon the successful transfer of my SEVIS ID, the four-year  mailed me a new I-20 effectively rendering the previous I-20 with my previous  ISO's endorsement for travel abroad useless. The new I-20 arrived on the 15th of January. Tomorrow, the 22nd of January, 2019, I have a visa appointment interview scheduled.  I have all the supporting documents ready, and I feel prepared for the interview tomorrow.   


From all I have written here, what could I have done differently? Will my SEVIS ID show both the original liberal arts college the previous visa was issued for and the community college I attended for 18 months? Also, my original visa does not expire till June 2019. Should I even have applied for my visa to be renewed?

&amp;#x200B;

I am presently in US on L1B and my visa is valid till June 2020. I recently got admission in Masters graduate program in US and will do my education (evening classes) along with the work but I might not be able to complete my graduation by June 2020 (end of my visa tenure). 

&amp;#x200B;

I am planning to leave US in June 2020 once my L1B work visa is over and return back to complete my studies on F1 international US student visa. 

&amp;#x200B;

Do you see any problem in getting F1 visa stamping done from India immediately after L1 visa tenure completion. 

&amp;#x200B;

Another option I have is to file COS now only from L1 to F1 which might take time 8-10 months looking at the current timelines. Here, I wont be sure on the exact time when I will get the change of status done. So, if it comes immediately, convincing my employer will be challanging as I would need sabbatical to complete my studies.

&amp;#x200B;

Please share your view points on what are the best option I have to handle this situation?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks a lot."

I am reapplying for a second F1 visa for a different graduate degree program. (Law with full funding.)

Honestly, my overstay occurred as an act of immaturity and I should have been more careful. At that moment, I did not even have the intent to come back.  I am profoundly sad and frustrated at myself.

At that instant, I did not inform my leaving the country or my unemployment to my DSO (immaturity), so my SEVIS record was autocompleted and I do not have any overstay on my record. 

I have checked with my DSO. I have not accrued any unemployment days so can I use my 120 unemployment days and 60 days grace period. If so, I would not be accruing any overstay.

I have already applied for OPT to work in the summer. But mid-April my university added an option for CPT for the very first time.

I talked to my DSO and they said it is possible for them to authorize CPT while OPT is pending. OPT seems to be very slow this year and there's a really high chance my OPT application can be late, so I want to use CPT to be certain about my start date, and if I can successfully withdraw the OPT I'll save a few months as well of my OPT time.

I plan to re-enter the US sometime in the beginning of June. I have heard that it is risky to enter the US if you do not have your EAD already. As a Canadian though, I can always enter the US on a B2 status. I was wondering if when I enter the US, I should tell the officer than I'm entering on an F1 status and that I'm waiting for my EAD to be processed, or instead if I should enter on a B2 status, wait for my EAD card to arrive, then exit and reenter on an F1 status. Can I even do that? If I enter on a B2 status, does that automatically invalidate my OPT?

      So now I am here with admit (green light from university to continue masters). However, I am at the last step for F1 visa interview for which I am quite worried. While applying on DS 160, I was honest with everything mentioning everything. 
      What are my chances to get accepted my visa?

Thanks"
,0,Going to interview soon but this is my second f1 visa. Any foreseeable problems?,2019-06-18 13:07:15,"Hi, 
So I have been to the US in 2012 and have been there until dec 2016. I have returned back and applied to a doctorate program. (But not a PhD) I have been fully funded. 
I have indicated that I have had an f1 visa prior to this.
My sevis record states that it's autocomplete and my return date is well before my EAD(STEM OPT) end date. They do not have my last date of employment on OPT. 
Will this cause any problems during visa interview? 
I have left my position on June 2016 and took up an unpaid position related to my major with an everify employer from June to dec. I've left in Dec.

Also, what questions can I expect with respect to me wanting a second visa."

Even though our parents can afford the monthly payments, there is no account that has all the money in it.  Does this mean it's a bad idea to use our parents as his sponsor?  If we use a family friend who is a US citizen, is that person required to pay my brother's tuition, or can you simply use someone as your sponsor then have our parents actually make the monthly payments?  This is all complicated so any guidance on the sponsorship requirements would be greatly appreciated."
,14,There is hope (OPT/ USCIS EAD Motivation),2019-06-20 19:46:54,"Hello international students,

Many of you are waiting for your EAD to start working and are scared that you won't be able to start on time. I understand how it feels, I missed an internship freshman summer because my OPT was delayed. Despite the many bureaucratic hiccups that you may find in this country, I want to remind you that all will work out for you. This is a country of opportunity, and it relies on amazing people from all over the world to be great.

My application for post-completion OPT was received March 11th and just today, June 20th (101 days) my status changed to card being produced. The USCIS has a huge backlog with EADs and very lacking customer support, yet I don't believe they have any malicious intentions. 

Keep working hard and stay hopeful,

It will come soon!"

However, OPT processing seems to be taking far longer than I initially anticipated, and it seems possible that my OPT will still be processing when I'll be scheduled to fly back to the US.

I have read guidance by the USCIS and some universities saying that the OPT application receipt plus some other documentation would be sufficient, however, I was hoping someone here would be able to provide advice (particularly because I also have noticed some DSOs posting here too!)

My couple of concerns are:

1. Am I generally guaranteed to be allowed to re-enter with my OPT application receipt and supporting documents? Or is this still very much to the discretion of the officers. Have many others successfully re-entered with solely the OPT application receipt?
2. If my OPT gets approved while I'm traveling to the US, or if it gets approved but not yet shipped out in the couple days before I fly, will I still be able to re-enter the US with solely my OPT application receipt? Or does approval immediately make my receipt ineligible for re-entry into the US?

I obtained an MS in accounting and am currently working for a public accounting firm as an internal auditor on my OPT; in addition to this job, I would like to start an online business, which takes the form of 1) writing blog posts about personal finance to make money from advertisement (generated from site traffic) and 2) selling inventory from major brands on Amazon (generally referred to as Amazon FBA); as far as I'm concerned, I would receive a 1099 MISC at the end of the year for the income I make from this business as I'm not intending to make more than $600.

I think I should answer Yes and disclose the incident but I'm not quite sure.I know Canada and other English speaking country shares immigration data and I'm scared that this previous mistake cause me some unpleasant trouble at immigration border even though my intent is 100% genuine to visit Canada for the holiday 

**Did anyone in a similar situation had any problem visiting other country for Holidays? I feel like I jeopardize my chances of visiting other countries which makes me so sad but I know it was all my fault.**"

I am aware that to legally work on F1 OPT, my employment needs to be in the same field that I got my degree in. But let's say I want to change it, is it possible to do without a college degree?

I graduated in May, have a job offer and am tentatively starting on the 16th of September, my OPT has been approved, and my EAD card was sent to a friends address in the USA. However, due to personal circumstances, I had to leave the USA after graduating and return to my home country (New Zealand).

Before heading back to the USA I have to reapply for an F1 visa with my EAD card and job offer letter since my visa expired when I graduated. However, the EAD card which my friend sent to me a few days ago from the USA may have gotten lost in the mail.

Does anybody have any idea if its possible to apply for the F1 visa in this case with just a photocopy of the EAD card? And if so, would a photocopy of the EAD card suffice of reentry into the USA (along with all my other documents). Any input would be helpful, thanks!"

,0,OPT STEM Extension while relocating for work and drivers license while status is pending,2019-09-14 05:38:17,"I have been working for a company under post-completion OPT (12 months). My OPT started Jan 2019 and will expire in 2020. The law firm that the company uses for all immigration processes (H1B, GC, etc) is saying that they will start the application process for the 24 month STEM extension soon since I will be coming up on 90 days before my EAD expires.     


Here's what I'm worried about. I will need to relocate for work in the next 3-4 or so weeks to New Jersey. During that time period, it is very likely that they would want to fire off the application. Where would the EAD get mailed to? I don't have an address in the new state yet. I know that I can send in a change of address to USCIS but they're USCIS and I really don't trust them to update things. Would it be possible to mail the EAD to let say, my current office/the law firm and have them mail it out my new address?  

  
Secondly, how would renewing my DL work? I currently had to renew my DL with my current EAD and they threw a big fit at first because my F1 visa is expired (valid I20, I94, EAD, passport) and said I wouldn't get a REAL-ID but would issue a regular DL up to the same date my EAD expires. But if I apply for STEM Extention, my EAD is automatically extended for 180 days but no new card is issued. If I had this much trouble with a valid EAD, I can't imagine what the NJ DMV will say about an expired EAD and pending application.   
I know I'm rambling on and it can seem confusing so if you need any clarification, let me know"

If your winnings are in excess of $300, they send you form 1099-MISC, and you have to pay taxes on winnings.

Due to to the fact that my country of birth has a high denial rate (sucks because I have no choice over that), I was denied a student visa twice for fall. Even though I’m a genuine student and I have the funds to pay, the consular officers only issue visas mostly to students with scholarship or waiver from a university. Sometimes though, the interviewers still deny students with scholarships for no reason at all, making them reapply more than once before they’re issued the visa. 

For spring, I decided to apply to another university and successfully applied for a tuition waiver for a semester based on my academic and professional background. I’m just nervous to attend another interview for fear of being denied a visa again. That may just put an end to my dream of getting a masters degree especially in a field that’s not available in my home country. 

Would it be better for me to defer the admission to fall? Though the tuition waiver is for spring semester, there is a chance I may get a waiver for BOTH fall and next spring if I defer. There’s no assurance I would be awarded the waiver again though, and for me that’s a risk I’m not sure I’m willing to take."

""why did you choose this university?""

I have also paid all my tuitions fairly, and I travel back and forth from here to my country(Kuwait) every 6 months. I also have a strong financial support from my dad, who is providing me funds. And on top of that I have lots of properties in my country to show enough prove that I can go back once I am done. What are the chances that my visa renewal gets rejected? Please, I'd appreciate if anyone can help me on this, the only thing that scares me is my GPA from community college, but ever since I transferred, I have been maintaining a good GPA."
,4,Traveling under OPT with a soon expired F1 VISA,2019-12-07 21:59:13,"I have been working under OPT and I was planing on going back to my home country for the holidays from Dec, 22, 2019 to Jan, 02, 2020. However, I juts found out that my F1 VISA will expire on Jan 04, 2020, which is only two days after my scheduled return date. I am a a little concerned if there would be a problem when I go through the airport with an almost expired VISA.. I have all the necessary documents with me (new I20, financial proof, offer letter from the job, EAD etc ). Should I be worried? Does anyone have a similar experience?"
,2,Travelling During Semester,2019-12-10 17:53:47,"Hi everyone,

I will be studying as an exchange student during spring term, on an F1 visa. I've been interviewing with a company for a summer internship in London, and they want me to go there for a final interview. However, their first available slot falls to the second week of the semester, and it is on Wednesday. Would I have a problem re-entering U.S. if I travel during the middle of second week of semester and come back 2 days later (hence skipping classes for two days)? My I-20 is already signed for travel.

As I've mentioned in the title, my cousin's F1 Visa was rejected a few days ago and she feels that it may be because she was not able to explain properly the reasoning to some of her answers, with the reason being she was given advice to answer as shortly and honestly as possible. With her semester at the accepted university coming up soon, she is wondering if she should try to apply again to not miss out, with her main strategy being providing more reasoning and explanation behind her answers.

Anyways, the main reasons she was denied is written in the following:

1. Staying at a relative's place: She answered that she was going to stay at her great aunt's place. The reason being (which she didn't explain to keep it short and straight to the point) her great aunt offered her her place to stay at since it's about 15 minutes away from the university she was accepted into. Keep in mind that all of her immediate family and friends live in her country, and she barely knows her great aunt that offered her a place.

2. Why she's taking a 2nd Bachelor's instead of a Masters: She was not able to properly explain that she initially wanted to take a masters in design, but her bachelors in multimedia didn't completely fulfill all the classes required to take the masters. The classes left for her to accomplish is not available in any of the universities in her country and she has already made contact with the American university that accepted her that this was her intention.

She genuinely wants to just study in the states, so this was a huge blow to her. She has made it clear to us that she wants to return to her country as everything she is comfortable and familiar with is already there including most of her relatives as well as all of her immediate family, friends, and boyfriend and that she is mainly doing this because her home (third world) country's educational facilities lack the proper support and materials for her educational aspiration.

Any tips and suggestions on how she can succeed on her second try which is potentially coming soon? Or should she make a different approach? Any help and suggestions would be greatly appreciated!"

I emailed this to Border Patrol, called them, the consulate and embassy but way to get though to anyone who knows and  no response to the email.

1 - I am a Canadian Citizen.

2- I was Studying in  New York under a F1 Visa. This was issued on 19th October 2019

3 - My course / program ended in December 20th 2019

4 - I applied for OPT in September.

5 - I left new York for Canada for Christmas on December 20th 2019, same day as course ended

6 - I received notification that my OPT was approved and a Card issued.  I was already in Canada when this happened.

Problem

\- I am confused because the OPT rule says I cannot leave once issued the OPT visa, but it was issued after i left. I need to be in New York to do interviews. Can i enter as a visitor or does this cause a problem?

&amp;#x200B;

Solution Options:

1 - Can I go back to New York under F1 to seek employment despite the course ending in December 20th.

2 - Can I go back as a visitor like any Canadian citizen. I would do interviews and seek employment. Would re-entering cause the cancellation of my OPT application / or refusal at border control.

3 -  Can I go to New York as a Visitor, and when I get a job offer, leave for Canada and re-enter under the OPT with Job offer documents?"

I've heard that if you are enrolled in an online program you don't get an F1 visa and therefore no OPT once you finish.

This program im trying to get into is kind of hybrid (they offer classes online and in person).

So, what if.... I complete 21 hours online, in my country without an F1 visa, and then enroll only the last semester in person with an F1 visa and complete the last 9 credit hours. Would I be able to apply for an OPT if I use this method?

The reason for doing it this way would be to save money since online classes are cheaper and I can just complete them from home."

I'd be honest in here,
I am an Indian/IT/M with an UG degree in CS engineering.

The usual course duration of a Btech Degree from my uni is 4 years.

I joined in 2011 but due to a very personal problem I could not complete my Final year project.

I was already placed and had to join the job to support my family financially in every way I could. I spoke to the company HR(offline) and was suggested to get everything done before the probation period ended which was 7 months for me.

I did and because of this by the time my final graduation degree came in my final year of passing was a year ahead.

2011-2016.
The good part about this situation is my university marksheet does not show any gaps, back logs or repeats, it just gives the year of passing and the credits acquired.

The bad part, is that I completed my graduation while on the job.

I'm concerned about my F1 interview and honestly am having second thoughts about applying to bschools and take on further investment.

My family is sponsoring my education entirely and the plan is to fund it through savings+PF+sell a piece of land for spring semester.Here is the breakdown:

Liquid Savings: $25kPF: $25k.The remaining is going to come from land which is currently valued at $80k.

I screwed up and wasnt aware of the exact funding proofs required so didn't plan ahead, and my dad doesnt keep above $30k in liquid cash at anytime as our local currency is one of the most volatile in the world so he has plenty of investments in land.

Now for the I-20, the document submission date is by **20th April**. Theres no way due to covid that we sell the property by then plus don't even need to touch it till December when Spring fees is going to be due.

What are my options to be able to show the require proof of funds by the deadline? Genuinely need advice here(should I email my uni this entire thing, is that advisable?)

I graduated from Berkeley in December. I had applied for an OPT however, my documents arrived at USCIS too late after the 30 days of the I-20. The OPT got denied a week after I got into Berkeley's master's program starting in August.  The OPT denial was on the 19th of March, which was a Friday. I waited till the Monday asked my DSO and they advised me to leave the country as I was out of status because my I-20 grace period got over on the 20th of February and the OPT was denied. However, there were no longer any flights back home to India and there aren't any for a while. I want to go to school in August but I might need to go to India and get a new visa. The consulate, however, might not open for a while and I'm not sure about traveling for such a long time and living with my grandparents who are in their 80s with the potential of getting them sick.

,2,5-month reset,2020-04-02 19:20:54,"Hi everyone,

I have a question regarding the 5-month rule of the F-1 visa. I am a PhD student working on-campus as a research assistant. I am done with all my classes. Everything that I have left are research hours, so I am enrolled full time. For my advisor, it is completely fine to work on the research hours as well as the research assistant job wherever I am – not necessarily on campus. I am now planning to return to my home country in January 2021 and to work remotely. I am aware that I must return to the US within 5 months in order to maintain my F-1 status, but how long do I need to stay in the US to reset the 5-month clock? Can I simply leave for another 5 months just a week after returning to the US from a close to 5-month period?

I told the post office, ""how come you delivered a letter that is incomplete?"" and they just shrugged and went ""oh well"", they don't remember where it was delivered to....

I applied for OPT and after calling, I was told that it was denied. I said I never received the package, and the worker said they will request new one but may take a month to arrive due to outbreak. They also told me that I may or may not be able to ""appeal"" the case (they don't know why I was denied) but if I am allowed to, the time frame from when the decision was made will NOT extend even though I never received the denial notice. I am pretty sure the address in the package sent was not wrong, but upon checking with the worker, they told me that in the system it has a house number that is incomplete (and does not exist in the area).I called my school office and they told me to wait until the new package is redelivered so we can know for sure what is going on.  


&amp;#x200B;

1. Have you experienced something similar, with missing package of denial case from USCIS, how was it handled?
2. Have you been denied due to ""missing pages"" ? And how was this handled?

However, the earliest visa interview dates in her country are in November, which is obviously a problem, given that the semester starts several months earlier. Is there any chance that this backlog might improve as the virus abates (hopefully) this summer?

I wanted to ask you what questions I should be asking the lawyer to get the best result from the consultation (since it costs a lot).

Assuming that the State Dept. does not resume issuing visas anytime soon, here are some facts.

1. I am aware that there is a process called the change of status. However, this takes long time, and I should be working while it is being processed, which could get tricky since the school starts in August.
2. I should be on F1 student visa to receive the scholarship and stipends.

On the side, I have one question. As part of the preparation, the school is processing I-20 so that I could get F1 student visa. I just want to make sure that getting I-20 alone does not have any impact on my current H1B visa status. Could anyone with knowledge confirm this as well?

,8,PROCESS F1 STUDENT VISA FROM A FOREIGN COUNTRY?,2020-04-26 18:03:12,"Hi guys,

I want to study my masters in the US commencing in fall this year, however as things seems, the fall semester will probably be shifted online. This is why I would probably defer the admission to spring semester. Then I would have like 6 months waiting time which I would like to use in teaching English in Asia which was always my dream. 

So my question is basically I’m from Germany (with German citizenship) and have already applied and chances are good that I get admitted to the masters program in the US. But I obviously need to organize my F1 visa, however probably I wouldn’t be here in Germany. Does anyone know whether I would have the chance (as a German citizen) to process the f1 student visa in a foreign US embassy, say in South Korea or Vietnam?"
,2,F-1 student graduating in June. OPT related questions,2020-04-28 05:04:10,"Hope all is well and everyone is safe at home. 

I am current in my last quarter of my studies in the States and are thinking about working under opt afterwards. My worries comes from this outbreak, since thousands of American citizens are being laid off and unemployment is at the a all time high; would it be possible for an F-1 international student to find a job in this situation. (Given how tough it is to get hired even before covid.)

My second concern is if I do decide to apply for opt, when would be the best time to do so during this lock down. With my understanding, F-1 students are allow to apply for opt 60 days after the completion of the program. And most people suggest F-1 student to start applying opt 90 days before you complete your program. It would be great if anyone with more knowledge than me can provide some tips or guidance. Thanks

TL;DR When should I apply for opt if I am finishing my program in June under the Covid pandemic"
,0,Questions regarding extending my F-1 visa,2020-04-29 05:16:37,"Hello friends

I'm currently in the US on an F-1 visa. I graduated from undergrad in June 2019. I am currently on a 1-year OPT that is valid until August. I have also been accepted to a PhD program that I am due to start in August, and I have initiated the SEVIS transfer process for that. Once I receive my I-20 I will be allowed to stay in the US until the program end date on the I-20, so my status in the US is secure.

However, the F-1 visa in my passport expires in July. I've been told that this doesn't mean I can't stay in the US, and that the visa in the passport is only used for re-entry. I was told that I would need to apply for a new F-1 visa in order to be able to re-enter the country if I leave. 

I have been told conflicting things regarding the process for application of a new F-1 visa. I have an Indian passport, but I have lived almost my whole life in Singapore, and that's where my family is, etc. I was told by my DSO that I would only be able to apply for a new F-1 visa from outside the US. They also said that I may be able to do it from a country that is not my home country as a ""third country national"", so I could do it from Singapore instead of India if the US embassy in Singapore is cool with it. 

However, my parents contacted the US embassy in Singapore, and they said that I could just do it somehow at [www.uscis.gov](https://www.uscis.gov). They said I couldn't do it in Singapore (they have my file on record because I applied for my initial undergrad F-1 in Singapore). I've poked around on the USCIS website for a while, and this page is the only thing I've been able to find regarding getting a new F-1 visa: [https://www.uscis.gov/i539online](https://www.uscis.gov/i539online)

Is that the right form to file in my case? If so, does this mean I can just do this while in the US, and that my DSO was mistaken? My DSO didn't mention anything about form I-539. If this isn't the right process, what is? Should I contact the US consulate in India and ask them too?

I understand all this is complicated by COVID-19, but since I'm pretty safe in the US right now, I'm in no rush to get this sorted. So if anyone has any insight into how this process usually works when the whole world isn't in the midst of a pandemic, that would be super useful.

Thank you so much!"

My OPT expires on May 31st but I can't leave the U.S anytime soon because my home country (Thailand) has implemented a travel ban for all of May. I don't see what kind of temp job I could get right now either... especially considering I only have 30 days to work lol. 

My friends suggested that I just put down in the SEVP portal that my end date at my last job was May 1st... and that USCIS ""wouldn't know"" anyway unless they check but it's rare? Is that true? It's obviously risky and I've been reluctant to do so – especially because I plan on coming back for grad school and potentially getting a green card in the future. 

Another option someone in this subreddit mentioned on another post was that it's possible to transfer to a B visa? I already have one from when I came to the U.S for university tours waaay back that's valid until 2024. Can I just transfer to this one and how?

I've been hesitant to tell my DSO anything yet –– not sure if I should be completely transparent or not.

I am applying for F1 visa from Mexico city as a third country national. I was filling up the DS160 and I encountered confusion in a few questions. I would appreciate if you can share your opinion/ideas/experiences on them.

1. 'Intended length of stay ' : I talked to a professor and he said that the average time for completion of the PHD program is 5 years. It's also the same in an [image](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JQr29KPZTwnOZcJg8CaghuGGNFAFRbuF/view?usp=sharing) describing the timeline of phD, on the website of the univ. But the program duration given on my I-20 is 8 years. So what to write as the answer to the question ""intended length of stay"" : 5 years or 8 years : as mentioned in the I-20 ?
2. It asks for home address and mailing address. Is 'home address' supposed to be the same as permanent address, as mentioned on my passport, or the temporary one here in Mexico city ?

That's all.

Cheers!"

However, I ended up leaving the U.S earlier than expected, on the 21st. I'm still currently doing work for them from my home country. I had asked my school advisor before flying out of the U.S whether I should put the end date for my volunteer positions as the day I left the US or May 30th. However, he ignored my question and just told me to report through our student portal that I'm leaving the States and would like to end my OPT. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, since my advisor didn't say anything about changing the end date on the SEVP portal, I just left it as is. I just logged into the SEVP portal on a whim, to save a PDF of my employment history. I found that next to my 2 volunteer employment positions, there's an error sign.... but I can't edit it. And at the top of the page it says ""Warning: Previously provided employer information from SEVIS is not complete. All required fields must be provided prior to saving."" It also says that my OPT end date was May 29th but it was definitely May 30th before. What do I do now? Should I be concerned, will I suffer any future consequences for this? I do plan to return to the US for grad school and for another round of OPT....

t3_gxq3as,3,Why Does Department of State Withhold Student Visas?,2020-06-06 12:28:14,"DoS has suspended all non-immigrant visa processes at 20 March. From this day, US embassies open up new appointment slots, only to revoke them later. Nowadays, July and August appointments are available. Yet, there is not even an ""indication"" on how they will proceed.

US embassies and DoS don't make any explanations on their plans. As incoming students, we need to figure out accomodation, travel and lots of other financial issues. The lack of communication on the US part is extremely discomforting. Even a statement basically saying we acknowledge this problem and try to have a decision by this date would work.

If US wants to keep its border closed, that is understandable. You can hand out visas so in case US decides to reopen, international students can travel in time.

US has reopened, my country has reopened. But I cannot get a visa to be able to travel when borders open. That is really frustrating.

Does anyone have any idea or information on whether they will issue student visas this summer or not?"

Basically timeline of  my situation:

* I dropped a course in Spring 2018 that put me below Full load and i could not sign up for one to replace it.
* Received a phone call from homeland security in the fall of 2018 stating that my visa has been terminated 
* I started researching the laws and consequences and what i should do as well as consult my advisor. We proceeded to begin the reinstatement process. 
* I proceeded with my classes as normal and never went under full load again. 
* Long story short, the reinstatement never went through because of a mix of stress, did not have enough money to pay tuition on time, also school administration was very slow.
* Graduated fall 2019, still out of status and cannot apply for OPT
* Currently living by myself in NJ, working under the table, my parents think everything is okay.

I was doing a semester abroad in Europe when the COVID thing hit. When things started getting serious, my University asked all study abroad students to return to the US. The thing is, the Europe travel ban had just gone in effect and since I'm not a citizen, I could not travel back to the US. I couldn't even return to my home country because it was in complete lockdown with no international flights coming in or going out, even for citizens. So I've been stuck here in Europe for a few months now but my country is planning on opening at the end of June so I'm thinking of returning back to my country, waiting 14 days and then flying to the US since my country is not in the ban list. However, my visa expires on July and I don't know if I need to return before July or if it's okay if I return before the month of July ends, let's say around 15th July. Does anyone know if it's okay?

My personal **best case scenario** would be to stay in Canada for a year (perhaps find an internship), and then reapply for F-1 Status to finish my senior year at the SAME school. I have two questions as a result:

1. Will being suspended (and having my F-1 status rescinded consequently), significantly hinder me when I reapply for F-1 status after my suspension is over? In other words, what are my chances of getting status back and attending the same school again after my suspension is over, given that I stay in Canada for a year? In other words, how feasible is this ""best case scenario?""

2. How will the loss of status impact my future work opportunities in the US?

The first question is the most important, but if you can answer both, that would be great. Thank you so much from a stressed out student.

On the off-chance that I am not able to go back to India mid-August, I want to file for a change of status with USCIS from F-1 STEM OPT to B-2. This has got me wondering about a few things:

1. Should I file right away or should I wait?
2. One of the requirements for such an extension is showing proof that I will go back if granted the extension (by change of status). Do I change my ticket for a random day in the future or is it okay if I share my current plan with USCIS and in the letter inform them that I will only end up using the extension if I am not able to go back mid-August?

The Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) still hasn't released official guidelines to universities regarding COVID-19 for their international student population. It is shocking that U.S. universities and their international student offices do not seem to be doing anything regarding the situation when it's impacting thousands and thousands of their students. Some universities are already planning the mandatory return on campus this fall for them to maintain their visas.                                                                                                               

We understand that this situation is extraordinary, which is why this lack of support for international students is alarming. International students represent a generous inflow of revenue to universities and colleges around the country, yet, their voices are being completely ignored. 

Some international students wish they could be taking the fall semester online and stay with their families back home, unfortunately, some borders are still closed. Some international students wish they could come back to campus and experience some normalcy this fall, but they probably won't get their visas in time. Some international students wish they could remain in the US and take the fall semester fully online because they have some underlying medical conditions.

Are international students going to lose their visas for trying to not get sick or spread the disease?

\_

We demand that the SEVP starts informing colleges on what their next step are going to be as soon as possible. 

We demand that the option to take the fall semester fully online be also given to international students. 

We demand to be included in the discussion regarding our education, health and future.

If you have time, please sign it or share it with international students or anyone you'd think would be interested in the issue.

Is there any difference between getting and F1 Visa and having F1 status? As a Canadian, even though not required, would it still be better to get the F1 Visa, or is it just a waste?"

t3_hfx09g,1,Opt stem extension fiasco,2020-06-25 23:51:43,"Hi,

I applied for the stem extenison and was initially rejected- i filed an old version of i-765 (dated 05/31/2018) and not the new version of the from (dated 12/29/2019).

I'm guessing that this was the reason for the reject since the i797 was never read. The building basement where all the mail gets delivered flooded and a bunch of it was straight up destroyed or went undelivered for a bit.

It was still pre my OPT end date and within 60 days of my i20 being issued so I just refiled with the correct form.

But during the process I asked my DSO what I should do. They replied 5 days later (after I had already sent off the application) saying they've cancelled and resubmitted my Opt extension request in Sevis and issued me a new i20 to apply with - which I never requested they do I was merely seeking advice on what to do.

My application with the old i20 is sitting in the uscis mail room waiting to be processed. Is this going to F it up? What should I do now?

I called USCIS and they told me to just wait and then mail in the new i20 if I get an RFE. This seems a bit risky to me. 

Any advice appreciated."

t3_hk5eik,10,What are possible risks or negative outcomes from pursuing a (part-time) online master's degree during post-completion OPT,2020-07-02 21:04:42,"Hi all,

I am finishing my bachelor's-level STEM studies at a STEM university this summer. My post-completion OPT is currently pending -- I applied recently -- and my plan is to find employment and work once I'm authorized to do so. Due to the upcoming USCIS furloughs, I'm following the conservative estimate that my OPT may not be approved until late 2020. Since there's so much uncertainty about when I can actually begin employment, I'll pretty much only be networking for the immediate future, and I'll start actually applying once I see that other cases close to my receipt date are getting approved or denied (I'll be monitoring [www.opttimeline.com](http://www.opttimeline.com)). I don’t see the point in getting a job offer now if my work authorization card could arrive 5 months from now. 

As a courtesy to unemployed spring/summer 2020 graduates, my department recently allowed us to apply last minute to their part-time, distance learning (online) master's degree, for Fall '20 enrollment. Many departments at my university offer similar part-time MS programs. My university doesn't issue F-1 visas for anyone enrolled in these programs: they can be done from anywhere in the world, so they do not show up on our SEVIS record if we already have one. I personally have international student friends and acquaintances that enrolled in these programs during OPT; evidently, our school's DSOs don't terminate F-1 statuses when students on OPT enroll in online part-time MS programs.

One similar part-time program at our school is a very popular one, to the point that it has its own subreddit. Some people on that subreddit have posted their experiences about pursuing the program while on OPT without any issues, once their DSO allowed them to. They say that their DSOs didn’t stop them since existing regulations (regarding part-time study during OPT) are minimal / a regulatory grey area, and that it won't constitute an explicit violation of any OPT rules for them to take these online classes, although there may be potential risks down the line.

I applied to my department's program and I expect to be accepted. My questions are the following:

1. How careful or concerned should I be about potential consequences, external to any action from my DSO, if I were to enroll in this program during OPT?
2. Would anything about the unclear nature of these regulations be different if I were to begin the program while my OPT application is still pending? Should I defer admission to the spring, when I expect to at least have an EAD card?
3. I have yet to request the all-clear from my DSO to pursue this program — I had very little time to apply, so at I’m waiting to be accepted first. In the event that the DSO doesn’t approve of my decision (which would be odd, since some of my friends have been allowed to do this), could I already be in trouble just from applying or being accepted to this program? Or would I only enter the tricky regulatory territory once I accept the offer and enroll?
4. One rather specific concern: I know for a fact that my university emits transcripts as one combined document when students have both an undergraduate record and a graduate record. If eventually I will need to provide transcripts -- whether it be for an RFE, or a STEM OPT application, or an eventual adjustment of status to H1-B or immigrant status -- could there be issues if my part-time master's coursework shows up on my transcripts? (If so, would it be advisable to request maybe 10-15 sealed copies of my complete bachelor's transcripts soon after graduating -- prior to my enrollment in the graduate program -- in anticipation of future immigration processes that may be solely interested in my undergraduate transcripts? )

Thank you for your help! Sorry for the long post, I wanted to make sure I didn't miss anything."

Yesterday, my manager said that they are offering me to continue working part-time when school starts, and asked if I was interested.

So my dilemma here is, should I talk to my manager about having restricted work authorization? HR knows I’m on CPT, but I don’t know how much my manger and my team knows. To me any work experience is valuable consider how hard it is for companies to even look at a resume that will require sponsorship in the future (even just for internships!) 

I know extended internship offers most likely mean that they are considering making me full time after graduation, or else why would they invest so much time and effort to keep an intern that’ll just leave upon graduation? I would love to have some clarity about their stance on my work authorization (even if they don’t think they will be able to sponsor me, but if they’re willing to let me work after graduation until my OPT expires, I would gladly take that!) but I also don’t want this conversation to lead to them rescinding my extended internship offer."

Tl:dr; Hybrid classes are okay, but you need some in person enrollment for Fall 2020 to maintain status. No online only option. 

Also, this just came out. Give your school a day or three to announce their plan. 

Update: I just received the official email on this from SEVP around 45 minutes ago. So it is likely some DSOs are not aware of this update yet. 

1. Students attending schools operating entirely online may not take a full online course load
and remain in the United States. The U.S. Department of State will not issue visas to students enrolled in schools and/or programs that are fully online for the fall semester nor will U.S. 
Customs and Border Protection permit these students to enter the United States. Active 
students currently in the United States enrolled in such programs must depart the country or
take other measures, such as transferring to a school with in-person instruction to remain in 
lawful status or potentially face immigration consequences including, but not limited to, the 
initiation of removal proceedings.      

2) Students attending schools operating under normal in-person classes are bound by existing 
federal regulations. Eligible F students may take a maximum of one class or three credit 
hours online (see 8 CFR 214.2(f)(6)(i)(G)).       

3) Students attending schools adopting a hybrid model—that is, a mixture of online and in 
person classes—will be allowed to take more than one class or three credit hours online.
These schools must certify to SEVP, through the Form I-20, “Certificate of Eligibility for 
Nonimmigrant Student Status,” that the program is not entirely online, that the student is not 
taking an entirely online course load for the fall 2020 semester, and that the student is taking the minimum number of online classes required to make normal progress in their degree 
program. The above exemptions do not apply to F-1 students in English language training 
programs or M-1 students, who are not permitted to enroll in any online courses (see 8 CFR 
214.2(f)(6)(i)(G) and 8 CFR 214.2(m)(9)(v))).


Please speak to your school about specific updates regarding your program."

So, I have been scratching my head over this for a while. I graduated with 2 degrees in art (one digital field, one hands-on field) and am still struggling to understand what jobs I am and am not allowed to work. I have read the general guidelines, so I understand that the job has to be at a degree-level (e.g. can't work as a hotel receptionist if you have a degree in hospitality/customer relations bc a receptionist is too low of a skill level). Is there some sort of resource online created by current/past opt students that show what jobs were acceptable for their degree?



The thing with much of the art field is that most jobs are ""degree or x years of experience"" because they look at what you can do and create, what skills you have- self-taught, from a formal institution, or otherwise. In areas desperate for workers they are also willing to train people with no prior experience on each task that needs to be done, although the starting pay is lower and it takes over a year of full-time work to be allowed to do everything the job requires.



If I take a job that says they're hiring someone with necessary experience and don't even mention a degree, and the job is 100% what one of my majors was, is me having a degree the necessary experience needed at a satisfactory job level, or can I get in trouble with immigration because of unclear requirements?



Hope my question makes sense. I will gladly clarify anything if needed!"

On Monday, July 6, 2020, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) announced that International Students in the United States whose schools have ruled for online-only classes in the Fall 2020 semester must leave the United States, or may face immigration consequences.

This is counterproductive for the following reasons:
- International students contribute ~$41 billion dollars to the US economy every year
- US universities and research programs depend on revenue from international students to survive
- US universities may be compelled to prematurely open in-person instruction and risk virus transmission
- STEM companies thrive and depend on global talent

From Brazil here and I have finished my master's degree in University A on August of 2019. I came back to my home country after that, and now  I was offered a Ph.D. GRA position at University B. Technically, my  visa expiration date from at University B is on 2023. However, I have been on my home country  (where the travel ban is on) for over 5 months, and I have been  approved to start my Ph.D. on University B this fall. My I-20 is on the  way, but it is unlikely I will be able to get me a new  F-1  visa because of the pandemic. I have reached out to the embassy and they  told me not to travel with my old visa from University A as it will not  match the new I-20 from university B. However, the international office from University B  said that they tipically don't recommend students to do so, but due to  the whole COVID situation, they believe I could be granted access to the  country as long as I quarantine myself for at least 14 days on a  country where the ban is not on (e.g. Mexico). But they naturally cannot  guarantee anything because it is not up to them. Additionally, my major  professor and other faculty members said they are willing to write a  letter and all of that in case it helps, so hopefully that together with  the funding prove could do it to get there it time. From your  experience, do you think I should follow their advise and travel with  the old (but not expired) visa and the new I-20?

I asked my DSO for the updated I-20 form, so I can show it during Visa appointment, but she said that my I-20 form is valid until August 4^(th).   


In my opinion, the updated I-20 form (with description of operational plan) is necessary for the visa appointment. F-1 visas won't be issued to students in entirely online programs, and that's why they would need updated I-20 form. I will call US Embassy tomorrow to ask about it.

Has anyone transferred their F1 student status to tourist B1/B2 while being in the US? What is the procedure, timelines, chances of rejection? Is this something I can apply by myself or do I need to hire an attorney?

I was going to finish my degree in August but extended it to provide myself with the teaching job security that comes with doing a PhD.

I was filling out forms for the hiring onboarding and completely forgot about my change of plans until the part where I have to declare immigrant work status. Fuck.

As a canadian, I dont actually have a F1 visa, just an i-20 for passing through the border, but I still have to follow F1 rules. having this job I think breaks my off-campus work rules if I'm not doing OPT.

Hey guys, I need some guidance.

I am an F1 student studying in the US and i have completed 2 semesters here fall 2019 and spring 2020. but i did not enroll in summer 2020 as it was optional and i needed a break.

I am planning to take a leave of absence for the fall 2020 semester. Trying to leave mid-August and I LL be back early January which is 4.5 months approximately. This way I can retain my CPT(as I have already done 2 semesters in the US.) and also reactivate my sevis.

But I am getting conflicting information.

1. My University advisor says that summer 2020 (optional semester) will be counted as leave of absence time. This makes it a 6.5 months leave.
2. My University's website and many other university websites and forms say: ""leave of absence time is the duration you are outside the US.

I read that if already 7 years pass, nothing will happen and the bill disappear but this sounds too nice to be real... I also read if you pay, the 7 years timer will restart again. (so if I pay now 2020 to collection, insteada of 2 more years, the bad score will start counting another 7 years)

\-Will this make problem for me when I interview for VISA to continue my study?  
\-Will this put me in a bad position for my status here with USCIS ?  
\-if I did not have social in 2015, will this affect credit score if I get social in 2019? (no one know my social only my school workplace have it.)  
\-If it was 1000 dollar from emergency room that went to collection in 2015, how much is it now in the collection?  
\-Will collection people try to find and come take me or send me to court/lawsuit? Do I need lawyer ?

No assurances are given in advance.*

*If you have a valid visa and you will be traveling to undertake OPT, you should carry your annotated Form I-20 and your Employment Authorization Document (EAD) in addition to your visa.*

*Please review the* [*CDC website*](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html)

I finished my undergraduate program last Spring, and I have recently been accepted to the Master's program of the same university this Fall.

Because of that, my DSO told me that I have no other option but to either leave and reentry the US on a different SEVIS and new I-20, or apply for reinstatement which can take from 6 to 9 months. I recently contacted the SEVP and was informed that my SEVIS is still currently active (not sure if it is relevant or not). My questions are:

1) Is there any other option? For instance can my DSO be a bit flexible and issue a new I-20 given the current Covid-19 situation, or extend the grace period?

2) Between the two options mentioned earlier, I am thinking about leave and reentry Canada to renew my f1 status. My visa expired so I would need to apply for a new visa again. Here are some questions that follows:
  a) Given this Covid-19 situation, is it possible to do that?
  b) Has anyone ever done that, and could you give me some guidance or advice?

t3_i8ofps,5,OPT Question,2020-08-12 23:07:02,"As stated on the USCIS website:

  
 Types of OPTAll OPT must be directly related to your major area of study. If you are an F-1 student, you may be eligible to participate in OPT in two different ways:

* **Pre-completion OPT**:  You may apply to participate in pre-completion OPT after you have been lawfully enrolled on a full-time basis for one full academic year at a college, university, conservatory, or seminary that has been certified by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) to enroll F-1 students. You do not need to have had F-1 status for the one full academic year; you can satisfy the “one full academic year” requirement even if you had another nonimmigrant status during that time.

If you are authorized to participate in pre-completion OPT, you may work part time (20 hours or less per week) while school is in session. You may work full time when school is not in session.          

* **Post-completion OPT**:  You may apply to participate in post-completion OPT after completing your studies. If you are authorized for post-completion OPT, you may work part time (20 hours or less per week) or full time.

If you participated in pre-completion OPT, USCIS will deduct that amount of time from your post-completion OPT authorization period. For example, if you participated in 10 months of pre-completion OPT, you would be eligible for only up to 2 months of post-completion OPT.  


Facts:

\- I am currently taking an Associate of Occupational Studies (that usually runs 18 months which includes 5 semesters including 1 semester of CPT/internship)

\- I am currently on my 4th semester. So next semester should be my graduating semester.

\- Due to COVID-19, we spent half of the semester online and half hands-on which is integral to my type of studies. We spent approximately half the time in the kitchen as opposed to other semesters and we literally learnt less material than the previous semesters' students.

\- With all the uncertainty, the next semester won't surely be at 100% and we will be most likely experiencing the same thing. We would probably not even have an in person graduation. So knowing full and well that the experience I am having is not worth the big American $$$ attached to it, an Leave of Absence (LOA) makes complete sense.

I am planning to do post-completion OPT. I contacted my DSO (who is new to her job) and she told me that in order to be eligible for OPT, I need to have completed 1 full time year of academic study consecutively. Taking an LOA would render me ineligble for OPT then. But upon reviewing the material available online on the USCIS website, there is no mention of any ""consecutive"" study. I have surely completed the criteria of a full time year of study and will be completing my studies. I called USCIS to get a clarification and long story short, the person I spoke with agreed with me. There is no mention of a consecutive rule. She brought this up to two supervisors and they agreed with me. They told me to communicated this with my DSO which I will be doing so in the next few days. Does anyone have more clarity on the subject matter? It would just suck to have been going to school for 2 years, be in good academic standing at that, and miss on such a great learning experience as OPT because of an LOA just until things become more ""normal"".

Passport with VISA just arrived (appointment took like 3 min), but I'm not sure how to best proceed since the ""start of classes"" (according with my I-20) is in about 10 days (I think I'm supposed to arrive before the start of classes). Trying to ask for a new I20 or something else from my uni to let me arrive later.

-I think they mostly switched to online, but my I20 and other documents don't mention anything in that regard (plus I will be starting my onsite research ASAP). Heard that having online classes only could be a problem.

-As F1 student (from Schengen zone) will I be allowed to enter the country even after the start date? Read somewhere that I could arrive up to a week late and be allowed in. Anyone know more on this?

-Since I will be studying at a minor city I will need to make an stop at another aiport before flying to my city (e.g. arrive to NY, then fly to my destination). In that case what is considered the point of entry, the first airport in US? Mostly worried about the COVID screening or whatever I will need to deal with in the border."

1. I reinstate my status with USCIS, however, I know that this process can take a long time and has an uncertain level of success.
2. I could leave and re-enter the country on a new I-20. My only gripe with this is that I will be treated as initial attendance. From what I understand, this means that I will need to have the same Sevis ID on my Visa as my I-20.

My appointment was scheduled for a few days back such that I couldn't obtain my visa and reach the campus before arrival deadline.

At the window, my consular officer told me, ""Your application looks fine, but I'll have to refuse your visa right now because you're not within 120 days of your program start date."" Context: F1 visa applicants ideally apply and get a visa within 120 days of their program start date, but since I had an appointment I decided to utilize it. I, infact, called up the visa helpline to ask, and they said that if I have an appointment I should take the visa.

I was issued a 221g(yellow) asking me to drop off my passport at a VAC within those 120 days(no other document). I know some people though who have used their spring I20s but their visas were issued anyway.

Will I be able to get my visa now? Is this normal? Could it be that the officer I had an interview with didn't know the policy? Will it negatively impact my casefile in any manner? Has this happened to anyone before or now especially? I'm very confused and need advice urgently. Please help"

I'll arrive in the US this Thursday at IAD Washington Dulles airport at around 5 PM, have a night long layover and fly to Tennessee the next day around 11AM, Friday.

I am required to fill out my I-9 related documents until the end of Friday, and I'll be subjected to 14 days long quarantine when I settle in a place, so I would like to open a bank account, get a voided check with routing numbers on, have a US phone number etc. before I go under quarantine.

Uber &amp; lyft are forbidden in my country so I cannot receive confirmation numbers or short messages to sign up in the app.

My two questions are; 
1-How could I use Uber or Lyft when I'm at Dulles airport without a US number and a US debit card (As I'm not sure if my foreign card would process the transaction for a forbidden app)? Can I take care of these two at the airport, and with no permanent physical address yet -just an airbnb? Will I be bound to this location if I start a bank account in that location?

2-Can I do these things when I'm under quarantine? I don't know how it works in the US, like can one go out for basic needs or not?

t3_ilv5gu,2,Gamble or defer,2020-09-03 15:06:44,"I have an admit from UCLA, consulates in India have started issuing F1 visa and I was almost going to apply for dates ( paid sevis and ds 160 fee) when LA county issued order for schools to not open. UCLA has advised internation students to not come for this semester, conclusively even if you have a visa and reach somehow they will not validate it.

Now potentially if I dont land by February I will miss out on OPT and potentially will be ineligible to work in the US. That is a big risk in starting school. Apart from this, time zone differences ( PST and Indian time), subpar experience especially when it's a graduate degree from business school.

t3_imdgd1,2,"Is one permitted to pursue a second regular MS degree (online, part-time) while on post-completion OPT?",2020-09-04 10:22:04,"Hi all,

I completed my MS degree in Computer Science last May and is working full-time on Post-Completion OPT status. I got the EAD card already. 

Last week, I have been accepted for a second MS degree in Data Analytics that is part-time and online only. This online degree can be done from anywhere in the world and by anyone regardless of location or citizenship, and so the new university doesn't issue I-20 and it does not show up on our SEVIS record.

USCIS states ""(B) Termination of practical training. Authorization to engage in optional practical training employment is automatically terminated **when the student transfers to another school** or begins **study at another educational level**"".

The MS that I completed and this online, part-time MS degrees are both at the **same educational level**. That is, they are regular MS as compared to an MBA which is at a different level than a regular MS. Furthermore, since there is no I-20 issued and it does not show up on SEVIS records, is one allowed to pursue such a regular MS degree at a equivalent level? 

Some people say it is a grey area. I read on Reddit that many pursued such online degrees. But is it illegal? Will I face any consequences when I apply for H1b or Green Card? If anyone of you have been in such a situation or heard someone in a similar situation, please let me know what you did."

My girlfriend is an F-1 student and I am an American citizen, and I want to know more about the situation that she’s in. She is trying to become financially independent while going to school.  

My first question is: 
How can she get a job? She says that in order for her to get a job it would have to be through the school that she attends, or she would have to get a written statement defining her skill specialization from her employer, and explaining why she is uniquely qualified for the job. This is hard for her to do during the current pandemic. 

I may have other questions to add to this post if i can get some responses to this first question, which is probably the most important one.  I really appreciate the help!  Even just a link to get me started researching on my own would be super helpful!  When I search for information about this, everything that comes up is complicated, and assumes that you already know the basics.  Everything that comes up is related to COVID or the recent threats to send F1 students away.  I could ask my girlfriend, but I want to impress her by finding out myself, also I want to make sure that the information that she has been given is correct. So where can I learn the basics?  It would be ideal to have some sort of discussion where I can communicate directly with someone who knows about this stuff, so I thought Reddit would be a good place to start :)"

I am an f1 student in my final semester. I am starting my opt application and in the form provided by my university DSO, there is a field which says do I have an employer already. ( This form is for i20).

Does the new I20 mention anywhere who the new employer is? 

I currently have an offer from a company, but I haven't accepted it yet and I am looking for other offers.
If I put the option as no in the form, does it, in anyway affect my opt application?

I know that we do need to have an employer to apply for OPT, but I am not sure why the DSO is asking you this information. If I select yes, the form further asks questions such as how does the job relate to your education etc. Does having an employer boost your chances to get an opt?

t3_ixqypq,2,Affect of full CPT on OPT,2020-09-22 16:36:04,"Hi,

I know that generally USCIS differentiates between CPT and OPT and if you have less than 12 months of full time CPT it's not a problem.
But this year, our dso has sent an email telling us to acknowledge the fact that USCIS may consider cumulative time of full time CPT and OPT ( which will be &gt;12 months of OPT) and have impact on our h1b and PR later on.

Has anyone received the same email from their dso office?
Cases have been reported as per this [link](https://www.nafsa.org/professional-resources/browse-by-interest/impact-full-time-cpt-eligibility-opt)

Is there any minimum OPT months required for stem extension? Can I get a stem extension after 9 months of OPT? 

Thank you."
t3_ixtg7f,7,Can F-1 Visa Holder Have 2 Jobs?,2020-09-22 18:40:48,"Hi all!

I currently am on f-1 visa in the US. I have a full-time job with a company, and I recently received an internship offer from another company that requires some remote work.

I really want to take this offer because this may be helpful for my future career progression. Since this will be a paid internship, we are wondering if it will be legal to be paid from both the places. Please remember, I cannot tell my full-time employer that i have a side internship, because they are super old school, and whether it's legal or not, they will not take it well and in turn, make my life difficult at work.

Please advise from a legal standpoint is it possible for me to be paid? If not, what are the ways I can navigate this situation?

Thanks!"

t3_j2z3b8,4,DHS International Student Policy Changes,2020-10-01 01:25:38,"Sorry if this has already been posted but it is important enough that word needs to get out. 

Under this new rule, F and J visa holders (international students, research  scholars) can only stay in the US for at most 2 or 4 years even though  their program is more than 4 years. **This new rule is now under the comment period until 10/26/2020.** 

I  strongly against this new proposed rule because it is based on a high  flawed measurement, add unnecessary cost for all parties, and negatively  impacts international student and exchange visitors, US higher education  institutions, and US employer.

Below is my reasons: 

**Based on a highly flawed measurement.**  The DHS ‘overstay’ reports upon which the regulation relies are  inflated and do not actually measure overstay rates. The DHS overall  overstay rate includes individuals who have already left the U.S. and  people may have lawfully changed status inside the United States and are  not actual overstays. That is, the DHS ‘overstay’ rate is not an actual  overstay rate but only an upper-bound estimate of individuals who DHS  could not positively identify as leaving the United States. 

**High impact and high cost for tax-payer money:**  This rule would affect well-over a million people’s life and cost more  than 237 million dollars per year for the next ten years. DHS estimates  the new policy would require USCIS (a government agent)  adjudicate 364,060 new extension requests annually.  It would  dramatically increase the number of applications to extend nonimmigrant  status filed, exacerbating already extensive USCIS processing  delays. The cost will not only come from the non-immigrants’ pocket, but  also will consume US tax-payer money on government paperwork  processing. 

**Forcedly increasing unnecessary workload on schools:**  International students and exchange visitors are already tracked the  national real-time SEVIS system and monitored by higher education  institutions and research organizations. The current system is working  just fine at reducing the overstay rate significantly over the  years (over 43.6% reduction from 2016-2019) without any extra cost. This  policy will compel all U.S. universities to use E-Verify and involve in  the extension process. Despite the increased workload and all parties  involved with no additional resources, ultimately the policy does not  enhance US national security.

**Leading to negative effects on the US economy:**  The new rule requires F-1 Post-OPT applicants apply for both EOS and  EAD. The Post-OPT processing time is already very slow (90-120 days),  and the current EOS processing time is even slower (7-10 months based on  official USCIS estimates). It is possible that pending EOS will let  applicants abandon their job offer and leave the US.  This not only  harms the student, but also hurts the productivity and benefit of the US  employer, leading to negative effects on the US economy and push top  talents to other competing countries. 

**Likely reduce enrollment and make U.S.**  Universities Less Competitive: The new policy threatens America’s  ability to attract international students due to the added costs and  increased uncertainty foreign students would face under the proposed  regulation. This rule will reduce the US higher education institutions  competence and make US lose talented students and scholars in the world.  

**Unreasonable to set visas to expire after four years:**  Average doctor program in US is more than 5 years and about 56% of  undergraduates in US take more than 4 years to finish program. The rule  will not only prevent international students interested in studying in  the United States but also burden current and future international  students with a genuine interest in continuing to study in the United  States.

**Expensive, time consuming and no guarantee for extension or new visa:**   An extension application for F-1 student will exceed $1000 and more  than 7-10 months for F students to extend/change status. The only basis  on extension - “compelling academic reasons” is not clearly defined,  which means that students may apply and find out months later that they  cannot stay even if the school supports the extension. 

On above reasons, this rule should not be considered.

**Everyone can submit comments on this policy and I encourage you to do so.**

I am working as a self-employed / ""work-for-hire"" as part of the first year of my F1 OPT. 

According to [https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/foreign-student-liability-for-social-security-and-medicare-taxes](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/foreign-student-liability-for-social-security-and-medicare-taxes), I am exempt from FICA. 

However, one of the last paragraph states that ""As an aside, and as a general rule, the immigration laws of the United  States do not permit nonimmigrants to earn self-employment income in the  United States.""

t3_j9y5dt,1,DV Lottery Photo Requirements Question,2020-10-12 19:52:32,"First of all, I'm sorry if this is not the right place to ask this but I'm assuming there are plenty of f1 students applying for the DV Lottery.

So I am entering the DV 2022 Lottery and I had my photos taken today. I went to a photo shop and asked for a passport template adhering photo that was for a visa (I'm in the US). They took the photo and sized it perfectly but also removed the shadow behind my head.

This was done using Photoshop. The shadow-removal was slight and made no important changes to the picture. However, the Photo Requirement in the DV Instructions state not to digitally alter the photo in any way.

1. Does removing those shadows count as digital alteration and thus, is ground for squalification?
2. Does the system automatically checks the photo's metadata and scan for photo editing apps like Photoshop and automatically disqualify the application? Photoshop could be used just for resizing and that doesn't mean digital alteration but if they scan automatically for apps like Photoshop, they have no way of determining how Photoshop was used to edit the photo.
3. Should I just use the unedited version and use the online photo tool to crop it and size it according to the requirements? I have the unedited version so I could go this way but the requirements also state that no shadows should be present in the photo (other than light shadows) which I guess my photo does fall under that category but it is entirely up to the officer verifying the application.

I know I am probably overthinking this but I want to make sure I don't hinder my chances due to technicality.

Thank you!"

While my school was processing my application to issue a new OPT Extension I20, they figured that my SEVIS got terminated in September by the SEVP due to not reporting to the SEVP Portal. I checked my school mailbox and found out that the email from SEVP to register for the portal went into my junk mail back in November last year.

My DSO is willing to do a Data fix for me since I was never unemployed. However, she also told me that the chance is low since another student got denied with the similar situation.

I've contacted several immigration lawyer and most of them refused to take my case.

I have my employment letter, pay stubs, and W2 ready to submit to the SEVP for status correction. Are there any additional supporting documents I should provide?

Does anyone have a similar case with success in Data Fix request, or any alternative way to resolve this issue?

Please help!!!!!!!!!!"
t3_ja3m7l,30,Any (legal) actions I can take against my evil DSO?,2020-10-13 01:09:34,"Hey all. An F-1 student in NY here. I got a DSO (Designated Students Official) in international student office who willfully neglects duties (refusing to extend I-20 when I have all the all the legitimacy), jeopardizing my academic career and ability to stay in the US to complete the degree successfully -- basically trying to screw me over for whatever her crazy reasons she'd probably never admit to.

Other than speaking to other people in the institution, is such thing punishable by any means, including legal? Or do you just have to sit there completely vulnerable and helplessly watch the complete absurdity unfold? Please share any experiences or thoughts."

t3_jagti6,1,Help! How to get OPT when CPT dates are filed wrong,2020-10-13 16:24:58,"I'm on a Master program for the first time, and I did a CPT work for less than a year. However, the authorization date my school put on my I-20 has been more than a year, since they only do start/end date based on semester calendar. I just came to know that this authorization date on my I-20 is actually the date USCIS going to look at as part of the OPT application. Most likely I will be doomed since the law says no OPT if your CPT has been more than a year.

I tried to talk to the school DSO and they have been total bitch about this, saying this is my fault not to notice within 10 days of the I-20 issuance.

I do have an employer verification letter with clearly dates that shows I worked less than a year. But I'm not sure if USCIS can accept that as a document to help me change my SEVIS record.

Talked to the laywer and they said school has the most to say in this case, if they won't change it there is no way for me to correct this. If I want a lawsuit with the school it would be hella expensive.

Has anyone had the same experience and solve the problem?  What are the other possible ways to still get OPT?"

t3_jarg1x,17,To people who have gone to an F1 interview in 2020 so far:,2020-10-14 01:51:21,"Did you disclose your social media?
I know the rule of disclosing your social media presence kicked in back in 2019 and I was wondering what the experience has been like for other people. 

Did you include all of your social media handlers?
Did you include some that can be easily found but not some others that can’t be verified?

I don’t have facebook or instagram but I do have snapchat twitter and reddit. I guess I can safely and comfortably disclose my snapchat cause there’s nothing there they can see. 

My twitter: I’ve said some things that I wouldn’t feel comfortable to be seen by the consular officers. I guess sharing stuff about US politics and election stuff could be seen as “foreign intervention”. Maybe a reach but I read a thread a few days ago where things like buying stickers or lawn signs for Biden could be considered foreign intervention since you’d have to make a donation to the campaign to get those. 

Reddit? Hmm tough one. I definitely don’t want them to see my reddit stuff whether on this account or the throwaway one. I get that reddit is anonymous but the US federal government has easy access to any information online. All they have to do is invoke one of the Acts that was passed post 9/11 which allows data collection without consent. I mean the NSA was exposed for it and it’s still doing it. There are multiple laws that are on the side of the feds and one agent simply asking an institution for access to their data, would be able to get it. Worst case scenario, they’d have to get a warrant or something along those lines but since most judges tend to take immigration security and enforcement very seriously, one simple “we fear the alien might be a national security risk” to the judge and he/she would happily give out the warrant/subpoena. 

I know that reddit seems like it might be anonymous but things like email and other personal info are stored on reddit and the feds could easily gain access to it.

So would it be better to just disclose everything or just the public ones like twitter/fb/ig?

One could say you could make your twitter and IG account private but that wouldn’t stop them. One could say you could delete your posts but once something is on the internet, it’s there forever. There are special bot crawlers on the web that scan every website and archive it and they can be easily accessed (see wayback machine). So nothing is safe. 

One could say you can delete your accounts and ask the social media platform to delete your data but even that won’t work. Most companies keep a copy of your data for maybe a year. Also, just because they say they delete it, doesn’t mean they delete it. If you’ve never signed up for facebook and you try to sign up for an account, fb already knows everything about you and it’ll start recommending you people you already know and even prefill your information so you don’t have to do it. It’s scary. 

One could say “hey, you’re asking for permission to live in this country and study for D/S and you’re asking for rights to protect your privacy but you don’t get that cause you’re an alien not a resident and it’s a privilege to study in the US”. While the latter could be debated, I do agree with the former. But let’s face it, all of this data collection and invasion of privacy is done on every single US resident as well so clearly they don’t have any rights either in that matter and clearly all of this hides behind the facade of “could be a national security risk” but we all know that’s just an excuse. They just want to collect as much data as possible. 

Sorry for the rant but the whole situation in the US with privacy and how social media can be easily used by foreign entities to cause divide and interfere with US politics has got me riled up. People need to wake up and realize that privacy is important and they should start safeguarding it rather than easily give it up. It’s the whole “if you got nothing to hide then don’t worry about it mentality”. I’ve noticed most (white) people here looove authority because they are usually not the ones oppressed by it. It’s the whole “my bully stopped bullying me and is bullying another kid instead and I better join him so he knows I’m on his side and he won’t bully me again” mentality. 

Anyway, back to the original question:

What was your experience with disclosing your social media presence? Did you give out all your usernames? If you didn’t, did they find out about that? Did they ever ask you anything about it?

Thank you!"
t3_jaygp7,7,I-20 TRAVEL REINSTATEMENT -- Urgently Seeking Answers,2020-10-14 10:55:08,"I am currently still in the USA studying to complete my second master’s program. My first program’s I-20 started in September 2019 and ended in July 2020. I am not switching schools at all. I am now well past the 60-day grace period at this point. My DSO told me earlier today that I will need to exit and re-enter the US to get a new I-20 signed. I am familiar with all the possible consequences, including the potential invalidation of my OPT (RIP me.) I do have an F-1 Visa that expires in 2024.

My major problem with this is that my home country, the Philippines, is one of the world’s biggest COVID-19 hotspots right now.

My questions are:

1. I am not transferring schools at all. **Once I pay for the SEVIS Fee and get my new I-20, I do not need a new F-1 Visa, am I correct?** The school on my F-1 and the school on my I-20 are the same anyway.
2. **Does my overstaying and going past the 60-day grace period invalidate my F-1 Visa?**
3. **Does a different SEVIS number than what is on my F-1 affect anything?**
4. Apart from my existing F-1 Visa, I also have a **B1/B2 US Visa that expires in 2028.** **I am planning to fly to Mexico and stay for literally a day before heading back.** I am aware of the fact that any tourist US Visa holder is allowed to enter Mexico even without a Mexican Visa as long as the duration is for less than 180 days. I am also aware of the relatively lax restrictions on incoming air travel to Mexico at the moment. **Would this be feasible to do on my end?** I am trying to spend the least amount of time outside of the US at all so that it wouldn't hamper my studies.
5. Alternatively, I have heard of people **simply crossing the Canadian/Mexican borders and literally making a u-turn back immediately after**. I am aware of the fact that Canada and Mexico have restricted non-essential travel by land. With this, I am thinking that all I have to do in this case, if possible, is to get rejected at the border and simply enter, present my new I-20, and regain F-1 status via re-entry.

I did a huge oopsie with failing to apply for an extension on my I-20, and I am honestly really anxious. Any help would be very much appreciated."

With feedback from the community, this rule has been modified. Please see the new mega thread for [Visa Appointment Wait Times](https://old.reddit.com/r/f1visa/comments/jghws4/visa_appointment_time_megathread/?)



Hello everyone. 

Today we had 7 questions about visa appointment wait times. 2 from repeat posters who have asked the same question at least once in the last 4 days. 

As visa appointment times are available both on a Embassy or Consulate's website as well as at [The Department of State's Visa Appointment Wait Time search page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/visa-information-resources/wait-times.html) I have created a rule automatically removing these posts. While I understand concern due to COVID-19 related closures, these posts are clogging up the front page and are an easily searchable item.

Additionally, I have added a simple set of rules to F1Visa. These are some place holder rules that will be modified as F1Visa grows.

I also want to take this time to say that, while I moderate the community we are a community. I want to hear from you about Rule additions and changes. If the community disagrees with actions we can make changes.

Also, I am looking for more suggestions and support for F1Visa's wiki page/FAQ. Unfortunately due to the election and immigration changes I haven't been able to make time to start the wiki.  If you want to contribute items please post them [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/f1visa/comments/j3kmju/rf1visa_faq_preparation)"

Got a call from a pretending ICE agent, the number was really from an ICE office; they also called me with the number from the police in my city to pretended they had a warrant against me. The ICE agent will pretend that you have to do the immigration bond and send the money before getting arrested. That I couldn't tell anyone about this while I was getting investigated otherwise it would show that I have bad intentions and it will be against me in court. I know I should have seen it sooner but he didn't ask for money just at the beginning, he was really pretending to investigate me and asking a lot of questions about my intention in the US and so on... I spent maybe 3 hours on a call with him and the police calling me continuously to scare me before I sent the money. He showed me the papers, the Immigration Bond form and explain it to me and let me read through it. Even after he got the money he still played the game that he would see me the day after with the papers done, and I still got in call with him for a few hours after he got the money for sure. So I didn't sleep well because I was still thinking of being arrested and going to court. But in the morning when he said that there was a possible bank account in my name (then he waited maybe 1 hour so that his chief can check everything), then that I might have been a victim of identity theft and that's why everything was happening in the first place; then he asked me for more money (because the police had a new warrant because of the bank account that I didn't report) but that got sketchy when I told him I had no money left and he told me to ask someone in the US and I could just send him as much as possible (I was like ""but wait the amount is not fixed? "" and he told me that he will just advance the rest himself), and that I could even use target cards (he was still trying to make it official by showing the p6 of the immigration bond that you can use ""coupons"") but he also told me not to call the police because he was still trying to prevent them from arresting me... I am quite alone here so that's why I got scared and was ready to do anything not to go to a detention center.

Well, that's just a part of the story. Anyway, I lost a lot of money like that and maybe he stole some of my information. I already did everything I could to limit the damage now and I won't get my money back but I just want to let my fellow F1 (OPT or not) aware that 2 phone numbers that look like official phone numbers don't mean anything."

I’m a Bangladeshi who completed his undergrads in the US and came home in December 2019. Was supposed to start my masters in August 2020 but covid happened and the visa office here was closed. They’ve opened it now for people to renew who are eligible for interview waivers but not yet for normal F1 proceedings. 
Do you think I should just try for the interview waiver? If so, how does one exactly apply for an interview waiver? The instructions on the website aren’t very clear. Also, they say to print your “interview waiver confirmation letter” and submit it as part of your application package, but how and where do I get an interview waiver confirmation letter?
I tried contacting the embassy but they’re literally of no help whatsoever.
Help please. Thanks."
t3_ji8gwv,5,F1 Student (OPT): Whether to enroll in 401(k) or not?,2020-10-26 04:48:08,"Hi guys,

&amp;#x200B;

Hope everyone is doing well!

I am currently working on OPT and have the option of enrolling in a 401 (k) plan, with matching contribution by my employer. However, I am not entirely sure on whether or not I should enroll, considering I don't even know if I will be here for a long time. I might even have to leave after 2-3 years. And as far as I understand, it would be a lot of hassle to take out the funds early. Or perhaps, I should just leave the funds till I become of eligible age..... but, that seems so far away. Very confused. So, don't know if I should go for this option or not. Kind of curious of other people's experience and opinions on this.

Thank you! :)"
t3_ji9l83,1,F1 Student: FICA Taxes Not Withheld?,2020-10-26 06:24:25,"Hello everyone,

Hope everyone is doing well!

Starting from 2014, I am on a F-1 Visa (Student Visa). I believe due to the 5-year rule and the substantial presence test, I became a Resident (for tax purposes) in 2019. I also believe that this means that I am responsible to contribute towards FICA taxes.

I started working this year (2020) on my OPT. I knew that some money from my paycheck was being deducted for taxes. But, I never really paid much attention to what taxes were being deducted. A couple of days ago, I realized that these were the taxes being deducted: Federal Income Tax, State Income Tax, LTD, Pretax Health &amp; STD.

Additionally, my paycheck states that that Pretax Health are excluded from federal taxable wages (Don't know if this is relevant).

So, here are my concerns:

i) Am I actually liable to pay FICA taxes?

ii) Are the FICA taxes not being deducted from my paychecks?

iii) If the FICA taxes are not being withheld, what should I do now to rectify the situation? Should I reach out to ADP or my company's payroll department? Who in the payroll department?

iv) Am I responsible for paying any other taxes, something which I would have missed out in mentioning earlier?

I am freaking out because I don't know if I have done something wrong and can't be remedied. I am in the process of applying for STEM OPT Extension and my company has just agreed to H1B filing for next year. I don't want that coming out with this information to halt/stop any of the processes from happening. Or worse, getting fired. I also don't want to run into any problems in the future, thus, want this issue to be taken care of now. Thank you so much everyone for their help! I really appreciate it! :)"

My question is, if I use the Spring 2021 i20 to get my F1 visa stamped, but I do not enter the US in Spring 2021, attend 1 semester remotely from India and then enter the US for the first time in Fall 2021: 

1) What will be my SEVIS status for Spring 2021? 

2) I understand that the university will issue me a new i20 to enter in Fall 2021, but will I also have to pay the SEVIS fee again and/or apply for the Visa again?

3) Will the 5-month rule for staying outside the US apply for me?

Hope you all are doing well! 

This might be a dumb question, but, still thought of asking. While filing out the Form I765, I came across the question asking to fill out the Employer's name as listed in the E-Verify site (right above the E-Verify Number). My company has been listed in 3 different ways on E-Verify, although, I do believe that they are all one corporation. But, yes, there are slight differences in each name. So, I am kind of confused on what name to use. Does it matter? Will my STEM OPT Extension be rejected if it doesn't exactly match to what they have on paper? And if, eventually, my application does get selected for H1B, will this be a problem?

I am so confused on this right now. I feel like I have already bothered the HR regarding Form I983 and I765 for the past 2 weeks. I don't want to ask/nag them for this too.

My current dillemma is I havent been paying attention to US law/regulations outside of the specifics for my F1 visa and all, but I want to remedy past mistakes legally.

My F1 status started in Aug 2017 (when I first came to the US as a non-tourist), and I didn’t work for the 2017-2018 school year. I worked throughout the entire 2018-2019 academic year as a teaching assistant. This past year, I once again did not work. However, despite that one year of work, I did not file taxes ever. 

What are my next steps now to remedy this? I earned less than $2,500 total throughout the year, so I didn’t really think it was consequential because I assumed i’d just get the full amount refunded, but I know that isnt how it works now.

Thanks y’all for any help in advance. I have big dreams to stay in the US for the foreseeable future and hopefully immigrate, but I don’t want this small issue to come up in future immigration applications (small because of the amount, I don’t think NOT filing taxes is a small deal though)."

&amp;#x200B;

Potomac Service Center, initial OPT

06/08/2020 Case was mailed

06/12/2020 Case was received (online status)

06/18/2020 Check was cashed

06/22/2020 Receipt notice arrived to my mailbox

08/17/2020 RFE was issued (I do not know about this yet)

09/23/2020 Called USCIS to ask for an update. Got the same info I could get from their website.

09/24/2020 Called USCIS again hoping to reach a tier 2 officer. The first person to respond told me I had had an RFE since Aug 17. My online status is still 'Case was Received'. No RFE notices in mailbox.

09/25/2020 Reached a tier 2 officer and asked them to forward my RFE notice to my email. Turned out the background of my photos was too dark (looked ok to me).

09/26/2020 Mailed new photos

09/28/2020 Photos delivered according to USPS tracking

10/01/2020 My response to RFE was received (online status)

10/16/2020 Made an expedite request based on USCIS Error (no online status update for RFE + no notice in mail). Made it through: Emma (their virtual assistant) -&gt; Sent ""Talk to a representative"" -&gt; Case status -&gt; Live chat with an agent -&gt; asked to expedite and sent my prepared formal message in pieces through the chat.

10/19/2020 Response to the expedite request: ""The expediting of a case allows it to be sent quickly to an officer for adjudication. However, your case is currently in-transit or under review by an officer. We regret that we are not able to give you a time frame for when we will complete the review of your application"".

10/22/2020 Changed my address to set my friend as a C/O (in care of) because he actually lives there

10/23/2020 New card is being produced (online status)

10/26/2020 Case was approved (online status)

10/26/2020 Received a SEVP portal account link to my .edu address

10/28/2020 Card was mailed to me (online status)

10/30/2020 Approval notice was delivered to my mailbox (with my name as C/O)

10/31/2020 Card was delivered to my mailbox (with my name as C/O)

&amp;#x200B;

Graduation date: 07/30/2020  
Requested dates: 07/30/2020 - 07/29/2021  
Dates on the card: 10/23/2020 - 09/30/2021

&amp;#x200B;

Key takeaway: If a lot of applications on your receipt date have been processed but your status has not changed, start calling USCIS once a week to get an update on your case status. As you can see from my experience, sometimes their website does not work properly when they issues RFEs and they may fail to mail the paper notice to you (all my notices but the RFE one were properly delivered). If this happens to you, call USCIS and ask them to forward a copy of the RFE notice to your email, so that you can respond to your RFE sooner. They do not advertise this option, but a tier 2 officer can do it if you ask. In addition to that, if you change your address at the last moment, the old address (in my case I changed only C/O, so it was not a big deal) may still be used by USCIS.

Also, some people ask how much time it takes USCIS to process a response to an RFE. In my case it was 23 days."

So USCIS sent a reject notification to me yesterday due to wrong fee amount in check. In particular, USCIS had decided to change the OPT form filing fee to 550$ effective October 2nd but some court in CA froze this change. So, I send 550$ instead of 410$, hence the rejection.

Could anyone give me some hints on what to be careful when filing for the second time? A few questions I have:

1) Should I print and send all the documents from scratch? Is there anything else to add except from the green page that they sent to me in the rejection notice?

2) What should I answer in I-765 form, question 12, where they ask if I have previously filed an I-765?

3) Is there anything else that the university immigration should provide except for an updated OPT I-20 (since it is only valid for 30 days for filing purposes)? They do not seem very easy to talk to at the moment.

4) And finally, is it the case that I can have my case completely denied if I get another rejection from any similar silly mistake?

Some of those questions might seem silly but I am freaking out a little bit :S

t3_jr80r5,2,Proof of F1 Visa for withholding FICA taxes,2020-11-09 22:29:48,"Hope everyone is doing well!

**My Background:** I entered the US in Fall 2014, on F1 Visa, to pursue my undergraduate studies. I graduated in Spring 2018 and started my graduate studies (in a completely different school) in Fall 2018. I currently work for a company on OPT, based on my graduate degree. I have been on F1 Visa the entire time and I assume that since there were no (long?) breaks in between, I have been in the US on F1 Visa for the past 6 years. Is this correct assumption? If yes, that means that currently, I am considered a resident for tax purposes, making me liable for FICA taxes. Again, correct assumption?

**The Question:** I realized that the FICA taxes were not being withheld from my paystubs. I reached out to my company's payroll department recently and was given the response that since I only started working this year and my OPT EAD card is only valid from sometime starting this year through the next year, they have no way of knowing how long have I been on my current F1 visa. Thus, they haven't withheld FICA taxes from my paystubs. All of this does makes sense to me. I am now trying to compile proof of being on F1 Visa for the past 6 years.

**Possible Solutions:** I was wondering if the following documents will be enough to provide proof of my F1 status:

i. Scanned copies of my expired, undergraduate F1 Visa and the current/unexpired graduate F1 Visa.

ii. I-94 Travel History: Unfortunately, they don't go as back as 2014, but, I have entries starting from 2015.

Thank you so much! :)"
t3_jr95zd,2,I-20 Extension,2020-11-09 23:30:38,"I added a second major and a minor this semester and all of the requirements combined would take me an extra semester to complete. However I have also failed two classes that I need to retake, but I'll be catching up on that in the summer instead of taking it during the semester so that I'm still making normal progress, but that would still mean I'd need an extra semester to graduate. Would this negatively impact me when requesting an I-20 extension? With or without having to retake those classes I would have needed an extra semester.

I would not be requesting the I-20 extension to take the failed courses, and I still have a long time until the expiry date (it expires in 2024)."

It's frustrating because the instructions from my school's DSO were conflicting and from my research online - some sources tell you to put down N/As, others tell you to leave a blank space. My school told us to leave blank spaces. Has anyone had their OPT application rejected because they left blank spaces instead of N/As?

My mothers Income: 15 lakh

My father's income: 6 to 8  lakh

It has been a difficult time for all of us due to COVID-19.

I just accepted an offer for a 3 month paid internship starting beginning of December which means it'll end beginning of March. I'm currently in the first year of my post-completion OPT and it is slated to end April 27th of 2021.

I have a master of science major in Mechanical Engineering and I was planning on finding another job (hopefully one with a longer duration) right after, so preferably by mid march or end of march (At least a month before my OPT period ends on April 27th). Does that give me enough time for me to file for an STEM OPT extension? I heard that as long as they receive my application before that date, I have an extra 180 days to wait on their decision.

My concern is that some companies will refuse to hire me if I haven't gotten the approval of the STEM OPT extension but the thing is I can't have a job if they won't hire me because of that.

Does anyone here have experience with finding a job a month or two before their OPT ends and successfully getting a STEM OPT extension? Any advice or recommendation is appreciated."

(The following information is part of the consent form in the posted link. You will find some screener questions before being able to give your consent to participate in the study)

**READ CAREFULLY** 

IRB

**What are some general things you should know about research studies?**

You are invited to take part in a research study. Your participation in this study is voluntary. You have the right to be a part of this study, to choose not to participate, and to stop participating at any time without penalty. The purpose of this research study is to gain a better understanding of the cultural experiences of international undergraduate or graduate students with the Optional Practical Training visa have in organizations in the United States. We will do this by asking you to complete an interview for 30 minutes over Zoom that will be audio-recorded.

You are not guaranteed any personal benefits from being in this study. Research studies also may pose risks to those who participate. You may want to participate in this research because findings may indicate what cultural experiences international undergraduate or graduate students with the OPT visa have in organizations in the United States. You may not want to participate in this research because you will be asked about your personal experience as an international undergraduate or graduate student cultural experience in organizations in the United States. 

Specific details about the research in which you are invited to participate are contained below. If you do not understand something in this form, please ask the researcher for clarification or more information. A copy of this consent form will be emailed to you. If, at any time, you have questions about your participation in this research, do not hesitate to contact the researcher(s) named above or the NC State IRB office. The IRB office’s contact information is listed in the What if you have questions about your rights as a research participant? section of this form.

**What is the purpose of this study?**

The purpose of the study is to better understand international undergraduate or graduate students’ (with OPT Visa) cultural experiences inside organizations in the United States. 

**Am I eligible to be a participant in this study?**

There will be approximately 20-30 participants in this study.

In order to be a participant in this study, you must agree to be in the study and meet two criteria: (a) be an international undergraduate or graduate student and (b) employed or was employed in the United States with the OPT visa.

You cannot participate in this study if you do not want to be in the study, or you do not consent to an audio recording of the interview, or you do not meet the participant criteria listed above.

**What will happen if you take part in the study?**

If you agree to participate in this study, you will be asked to complete this consent form and your availability for an interview over Zoom and to do an interview on Zoom that will take about 30 minutes of your time and be audio recorded. The interviewer will ask you to reflect on your experiences as an international student with an OPT visa in the United States. Because the interview will ask about your personal experiences, you will need to choose a location to do the Zoom interview that is quiet and private. Recommended locations would be a remote office, bedroom, or quiet living room. You will be able to skip any question you want and to end the interview at any time. You will not be forced to answer any questions you are not comfortable with.

The total amount of time that you will be participating in this study is 30 minutes.

**Recording** 

If you want to participate in this research, you must agree to be audio recorded. If you do not agree to be audio recorded, you cannot participate in this research.

**Risks and benefits**

There are minimal risks and no direct benefits to your participation in the research. The indirect benefits are helping organizations to potentially create a more inclusive organizational culture that employee international undergraduate or graduate students through the OPT visa program.

**Right to withdraw your participation** 

You can stop participating in this study at any time for any reason. In order to stop your participation, please contact the student researcher, Paola Mejía, at [pamejia@ncsu.edu](mailto:pamejia@ncsu.edu) and (919) 904-3960. You may also contact the faculty point of contact for this research, Dr. Joann Keyton, at [jkeyton@ncsu.edu](mailto:jkeyton@ncsu.edu) or (919) 208-3092. If you choose to withdraw your consent and to stop participating in this research, you can expect that the researcher will redact your data from their data set, securely destroy your data, and prevent future uses of your data for research purposes wherever possible. 

**Confidentiality, personal privacy, and data management**

Trust is the foundation of the participant/researcher relationship. Much of that principle of trust is tied to keeping your information private and in the manner that I have described to you in this form. The information that you share with me will be held in confidence to the fullest extent allowed by law. 

Protecting your privacy as related to this research is of most importance to me. There are very rare circumstances related to confidentiality, where I may have to share information about you. Your information collected in this research study could be reviewed by representatives of the University, research sponsors, or government agencies (for example, the FDA) for purposes such as quality control or safety. In other cases, I must report instances in which imminent harm could come to you or others. 

How I manage, protect, and share your data are the principal ways that I protect your personal privacy. Data that will be shared with others about you will be re-identifiable.

**Re-identifiable.** Re-identifiable data is information that I can identify you indirectly because of my access to information, role, skills, a combination of information, and/or use of technology. This may also mean that in published reports others could identify you from what is reported, for example, if a story you tell us is very specific. If your data is re-identifiable, I will report it in such a way that you are not directly identified in reports. Based on how we need to share the data, I cannot remove details from the report that would protect your identity from ever being figured out. This means that others may be able to re-identify from the information reported from this research.  

**Future use of your research data**

Without broad consent, your information, even with identifiers removed, will not be kept for future research by anyone.

**Compensation** 

There is no compensation for your participation in this study. 

**What if you are a student?**

Your participation in this study is not a course requirement and your participation, or lack thereof, will not affect your class standing or grades.  

**What if you are an employee?**

Your participation in this study is not a requirement of your employment, and your participation, or lack thereof, will not affect your job.  

**What if you have questions about this study?**

If you have questions at any time about the study itself or the procedures implemented in this study, you may contact the researcher, Paola Mejía, at [pamejia@ncsu.edu](mailto:pamejia@ncsu.edu) or (919) 904-3960.

I plan on traveling to Mexico for a week during Christmas but my fear is that because I transferred school within the same semester without meeting the minimum requirements of credit points as I only had 2 credits before the transfer, I may be denied re-entry when returning to the US

This is mostly because I feel the immigration guys will find it shocking that a school agreed to transfer a student to another school without satisfying the minimum criteria.

So, I applied for an emergency appointment and got accepted today for 1 December at 9:15 am. 

Looking through this subreddit I found that mentioning a relative on your interview is a problem,

FYI, My sister lives in the USA, she is married and has a greencard, her husband is in the US Army and for problems with getting the bank statement in the USD currency, my sister is going to sponsor me for my school but in reality my mother is going to pay for my tuition and the other fees. To add too, I'm not going to live in the campus but in my sister's house so that way I have only to pay for the tuition fees since the school is very close to her house. 

Would this be a problem for them ?

I'm hella scared because this is my only chance of getting the visa since my school starts on January 2021, so if I get rejected this time I have no other choice to wait for the next year since appointments aren't available plus I have only one chance of applying for the emergency appointment

I'm from Italy

He finished his first master's in Fall2018. Program end date is 12/15/2018.His opt i-20 issued date was 11/16/2018. But OPT application packet reached to USCIS on 12/21/2020. Because of the 30 day rule his initialOPT was denied on 3/21/2021.

&amp;#x200B;

Since he is past 60 day grace period from the program end date when he got the denial notice, his sevis should be either inactive/terminated. He should enroll into a new program and cross the boarder.

&amp;#x200B;

But his DSO enrolled him into another program with same degree level and he got his i-20 with the same sevis and he doesn't crossed the boarder. He is about to finish his second masters and will be applying for OPT again. 

&amp;#x200B;

1) Since he is applying for OPT again with the same degree level and with the same sevis but with a different program, will he face any complications this time? 

&amp;#x200B;

2) Did anyone of you or your friends had gone through the same situation i.e. once their initialOPT is denied after grace period(i.e., 60 days after program end date) but enrolled into a program with same sevis without applying for re-instatement/crossing the boarder and got their initialOPT for the second Master's?

Please let us know your opinions and suggestions on these two as he is applying for OPT again, your valuble suggestion will definitely help him to go through the process and get OPT this time."

I'm writing this on behalf of a friend of mine, as I'm trying to figure out what legal remedies exist. My friend originally came to the United States three years ago on a J1 visa. While here, she began studying at a local university and she requested a change in status from USCIS from J1 to F1 status.   


After receiving approval from USCIS, she returned to her home country so she could change her visa from J1 to F1 and also to see her family. She had her appointment this morning in her home country, and the consular officer rejected her F1 visa because he didn't believe her university sponsorship was credible. She had a financial sponsor (her boyfriend, who's here on a diplomatic visa), letters from her university, documents, etc where she serves as the VP of the student body and where she has a full scholarship. Per what she told me, the officer opted to deny her F1 visa after she failed to produce official transcripts from her university even though she had access to unofficial transcripts.

t3_k7w04e,4,Consulates overbooked. No appointments in sight. Start spring semester online instead?,2020-12-06 15:48:05,"With the current situation, at least here in India, it seems highly unlikely that everyone will be able to get an appointment to make it to the Spring 2021 semester in January. There are literally thousands and thousands of people out there, making chat groups, flying between cities in the midst of lock  downs, coordinating and alternatively checking for appointments 24 hours a day in order not to get locked out, waiting for months, trying to just be lucky few that manage to quickly grab the 10-ish slots that randomly pop up on average each day...

With no clear information from the consulates, I highly doubt they'll be able to accommodate so many applicants by the end of this month. I had an admit for Fall 2020, but deferred it to Spring 2021. Now with my start date barely 45 days away, my university reached out and offered a second deferral and an option to opt online.

I just wanted to know a few things, if I don't make it:

* Is it less likely to be rejected in a visa application since I've already started my course? Or is this a risk that will always exist?
* Do I need to have proof-of-funds in liquid form for the visa interview next year? I had arranged for them in liquid form just for the I-20 and the interview, but it wouldn't be a good idea to keep a big amount just lying around making barely any interest at all.
* Are there any downsides to starting the spring semester online? Any problems with internships and OPT? Is there any crucial information that anyone opting for an online semester internationally should know?

Miscellaneous question:

* The courses that I opted for the Spring semester are all ""online"", although the university is running a hybrid model. If the new guidelines next year mention no travel for online courses, will all the effort to get a visa right now pointless?

t3_k9i9gf,5,How to get a car?,2020-12-09 01:49:11,"Hi there!

I am an international student from Asia who is pursuing an MBA degree here in Missouri, USA. One thing’s for certain since I got here and that is the importance of getting a car.  I need help/advice on where to get a cheap car, even the most basic ones as long as they run well and do not need a lot of fixing. Naturally, getting an auto loan would be a logical choice but it is not really possible right now. I am still starting out without a proper source of income and may not have the credit score they want since I also have an existing student loan. In addition, I feel like car dealerships don’t have enough means or resources for an international student to purchase a car(correct me if I’m wrong).
I am faced with this dilemma for months and I tried Facebook marketplace but I haven’t had the best of luck there. 

So now, I am not sure where to go or how to purchase a car.

I badly need help on this.

I'm American. My girlfriend is from Mexico and wants to go to school here to become a physician's assistant. 

Her J1 expires in June

What's the best strategy for her to apply? I read that she has to go back to Mexico for 2 years according to INA 212(e). But she can waive that and put it off until after her F-1.

We haven't started looking at schools or anything yet, so if you know a school with a decent physician's assistant program we'd appreciate your opinion. We're in Boston.

Besides being her financial sponsor, is there anything that I can do to help her?

Thank you!"

Apparently the scam is taking place over the phone. The scammers are using the SEVP Response Center (SRC) phone numbers (703.603.3400 and 800.892.4829) and pretending to be SEVP representatives inquiring about I-94 numbers and monetary transactions. If you ever receive a suspicious phone call, hang up and notify the OIA. Furthermore, please remember the following:
-	Government officials from any US department, including SEVP, will NEVER ask international students to provide debit/credit card information, gift card numbers, wire transfers, bitcoin deposits, or bank routing numbers. You will NEVER be asked to make a payment over the phone. 
-	NEVER give personal or financial information to unknown callers.

I recently came across the company named Aptive and they’re hiring internships right now but I am not sure it is the way to go. 

The initial task/job for me was to do door to door sales for their product but my school suggested that I should find another internship opportunity as an MBA student because doing door to door sales does not really line up well with the degree. So I contacted the recruiter and tried to withdraw my application. However, the guy did not want to accept it and tried to offer me the same job type he does which is to recruit potential salesman to join in his team and sell the products. At first, it sounded appealing because I can earn and having a recruiter/leadership type of role would also be good for my resume. 

But upon some research I also saw some comments online about how this company is like a networking or pyramid scheme which is a bit concerning. Also, as an international student, I am concerned that they might not be a good stepping stone for me to get sponsored for an H1B visa. 

What do you guys think? Is it a good company to work for or should I move on somewhere else?

I am planning to go back to my home country to be reunited with my family and **renew** my expired F1 Visa next week but after hearing a lot about F1 Visa rejection horror stories, I got a little spooked and I'm currently reconsidering going home. Given my situation, I would love to hear your thoughts/advice/concerns and if it is likely that my F1 visa renewal will be approved.

&amp;#x200B;

* Graduated this month (Masters) from a well known university
* F1 Visa expired in *July 2020*
   * Had plans to go back to my home country in *May 2020* and renew the Visa while I was still in school but due to COVID, these plans were cancelled
* OPT is approved and I have my EAD at hand
* Currently have a job lined up in the U.S.
   * This job was from a U.S. return offer from my summer internship. Originally, this internship was supposed to be in my home country (planned to go back in May 2020), but due to COVID, all internships for this company become virtual and I was transferred to the U.S. team (I was stuck in the U.S. at this time).
* I have a sibling living in the U.S. with me (B1 Visa), but the rest of my family is in my home country

&amp;#x200B;

I talked to my school's ISSO, and they told me that F1 Visa renewals on post completion OPT is *very rare*, and can also be appealed if rejected. However, when I spoke with an immigration attorney from my home country, he told me that the chances of my Visa renewal being approved would be 50/50, which is a lot lower than I have expected. I'm very conflicted, especially after hearing 2 different points of view from officials.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the long post, but any advice/help will be greatly appreciated!

TLDR; How likely are F1 visa renewals rejected when you have just graduated and received an approved post-completion OPT?

I filled in the paperwork at my university, specifying that I am on an F-1 visa, including my SSN, home country, everything I did when I applied for my prior TA position. The paperwork was slightly different, since it was a separate HR at my university that this position was through. I worked for 2 months in this position over the summer.

Well, at the end of the program, all students who wanted the stipend from this NSF grant had to upload a certificate proving that they are permanent residents. I didn't have to do this. I was not a student in the program, rather, a teaching assistant. However, I did read online that some NSF grants only allow funding for US citizens and permanent residents, and it seems like this just might be one of those grants. If so, have I broken the rules? I filled in the paperwork as truthfully as I could, worked closely with an HR person and the professor who offered me this position, but I have this anxiety-inducing feeling that I have done something wrong. Did I? Is there a reason for me to be afraid / can I get in trouble for this?"

t3_kltyzp,5,OPT Unemployment Clock Question,2020-12-28 16:49:44,"Hello!

So I have an OPT employment that needs to be reported to the SEVP. I have an offer letter with me and the position is valid OPT employment. The start date on the letter is 24th Dec and today is 28th. I only have 2 more days of unemployment left out of the maximum allowable 90 days (starting from Oct 1 2020, that would make 29th Dec 2020 my 90th day of unemployment)

My question is if I enter the details into the SEVP portal today and enter the start date as 24th Dec, does that stop counting unemployment days from 24th (the start date) or from today(when I enter it into the SEVP portal)? I'm really confused and need to know if I can still have more unemployment days in my buffer. Any help is appreciated. Thanks!"

My timeline:

1. Been in US since 2010. H4 visa expires Oct 4, 2020. So I applied for F1 visa in Feb 2020.
2. I got an RFE in Aug 2020. USCIS messed up my school name and credits. I submitted the RFE in the same month.
3. But on Dec 3, 2020. USCIS automatically denied and reopened my case. This shows on the case status tool. But when I talk to an agent, they say its denied. So I am getting mixed answers.

I am wondering why they reopened it by themself.

Currently, I am still in the US. Should I go back home to get an F1 visa through interview, and then come back to US?"

I came to the US in 2016 on an F1 visa (expires  June 2021) to start a PhD program and I decided to start working after getting my MS. 

I'm on STEM OPT and was trying to travel outside the US sometime next year, once it's a little safer. Furthermore, I will also be applying for my H1B next year. I know it's okay to stay in the US on an expired visa, just can't enter without a valid visa.  


My questions:  
1. If I travel in March/April 2021 and re-enter the US in May (before my F1 visa expires, but close to it) will it cause any problems? Could the immigration folks ask what I'm doing entering the US so close to my visa's expiration?

2.  Is it better to wait till I know the result of my H1B and then travel later in 2021 so that I can set up an appointment to change over to a H1B and re-enter? I haven't followed the news, but I'm guessing the process has changed, and I will know the result of my H1B in April and won't have to wait till October?"

I went for my visa interview and the VO asked me a few questions. After that she asked for me **SEVIS fee receipt** but I did not have it. So, she gave me a **221(g) Yellow Form** with the mentioned document as ""SEVIS Fee Receipt"" and told me that I must submit this document at the VAC, where I had my biometrics taken. **The form looked like the below pic, but the mentioned document was ""SEVIS Fee Receipt"" instead of ""Administrative processing"".**

After this I went to the VAC and submitted these three things: 

* 221(g) Yellow Form
* SEVIS Fee Receipt
* Passport

The person who took these docs said that I need to wait and the passport will be delivered to my address within a week. When I asked him if my visa is approved, he said that it's not decided.

Just going to jump right in. My previous employer didn't withheld FICA taxes from my paycheck.

I'm an incoming international student at NYU and I'm applying for a US Visa soon, my concern is what proof should I give during the Visa interview if I'm asked what my living conditions are. I plan to live at an apartment but the problem is I don't want to commit and pay for an apartment that I haven't seen in person yet. So having an apartment contract is not possible for me.

My plan is to rent out an airbnb for one month and look for an apartment by then. Will this reason be acceptable during the visa interview? I can provide the receipt for the airbnb.

For international students who lived in an apartment how did you provide proof of your living conditions during the us visa interview?"

t3_kvdskn,8,Is it possible to rescind an offer during or at the time of E-verify?,2021-01-11 22:26:47,"So, I managed to secure an internship job offer at a local manufacturing company. I am now beginning to apply for my CPT authorisation in preparation for it. As I’m doing that, I refer to the job posting again and it mentioned “unrestricted work authorisation”. I would say that this p much means US citizen or permanent resident. I should mention that this company came to my (virtual) career fair and after I talked to them, I got an interview after 2 weeks and was told to quickly apply online before the interview started (an hour before or so). There, on the online application, I marked ‘Yes’ for needs to work sponsorship after. So, after the interview, I was extended an offer a few days later. I even provided a scan of my SSN card which clearly said “Authorisation by DHS” which clearly indicates I’m not a citizen or resident. 

Although I can get my CPT authorised because the job matches my field of study and ample information is provided in the offer letter, I get the feeling I might get screwed over during the “E-Verify” process because they’ll definitely notice my passport or visa status.  At the same time, I’m not sure if my employer knowingly gave me a chance knowing I’m a intl student. And so, I was wondering if it is possible to get your offer rescinded at the time of hire or “E-verify / Form I-9” process?  I’m scared to get in contact with my company to clarify because I don’t want to lose this summer internship and it’s already January and sort of late to start again. What should I do?

I have been applying for Ph.D. and jobs as well. I am leaning towards work but depends on whether I will land a good job on time given the current situation( also don't want to leave it on the chance--need to find a job a few months after graduating-- if I have Ph.D. decision before the job, I might consider taking it as Ph.D. in the schools that I have applied to is also equally appealing to me. I have not heard back from either and might take a few months for me to decide what path I will choose. 

Additionally, the OPT process seems to be very inefficient and I am not very familiar with the process yet (about to talk with school immigration advisors). If anyone is familiar with the process, care to explain? I have read many people having trouble getting the EAD on time and there are long delays. So, I am planning to apply at the earliest date.

BTW, my question is if I apply for OPT then decide to go for Ph.D., then what would be my options?

My F1-OPT has recently expired and I need to change my status to F2. However, with the recent delays associated with the change of status process (longer than usual receipt notice issuance time) my school has suggested reentry to US with an F2 visa as the fastest option. For your information, I have a valid F2 visa from when I was a dependant which will expire on May 2021. Therefore, I was planning to travel to Mexico and then reenter US.

However, our lawyers mentioned the following: ""Mexico is one of those borders that sometimes CBP does not consider it to be going out of the U.S. and may not update your I-94.  You can ask the CBP officer and he or she may do it for you but may not, so there is a risk.""

I am really concerned about losing my OPT by taking this semester (Spring 2021) off. I would like to know your opinion. 

Spring 2020:  Enrolled full time - Living in the U.S and moved back to my home country (Europe) in April. 

Summer 2020: Still in my home country - did not take any classes. 

Fall 2020: Still in my home country -  Doing a 1-semester internship approved by my university 

&amp;#x200B;

So right now I have 2 semesters left before to graduate. I must take 2 classes this semester (Spring 2021) in order to maintain my status but I have some financial issues and I just accepted a full-time offer at my company 2 weeks ago. My plan was:

Spring 2021: full-time job + 1 class OR  full-time job + leave of absence 

Summer 2021: full-time job + 1 class  OR full-time job (during summer we don't need to take classes- 

Fall 2022: quit my job in my home country  + go back to the US to take my last semester 

&amp;#x200B;

I am allowed to take classes from my home country for Spring 2021 but I clearly can't take 2 classes while working full-time. I just have an appointment with the International Student Services of my university and they told me if I take a non medical leave of absence, I may (low probability but still) loose my OPT and I need to fill a form ASAP. 

**This is OGS response:** 

f you will be on a leave for one term, you may be eligible to reactivate your SEVIS record and return to the U.S. with your current I-20. Please note that this is not something OGS can guarantee given that the decision to reactivate your SEVIS record is made by the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP). You can submit a request for reactivation here no sooner than 60 days from the start date of the term for which you will be returning.

If the reactivation is not approved or you are not eligible to request a reactivation, you will have to return on a new, initial I-20. This means that you will have to re-pay the SEVIS fee and you will have a new SEVIS ID. In this case, you will not be eligible for employment benefits (CPT and OPT) until you have maintained your F-1 status for at least one academic year from the program start date on the new I-20. You can submit a request for a new I-20.

While OGS is never able to guarantee that a reactivation request will be approved, reactivations are typically only denied if you stop attending classes and/or depart the U.S. before applying for a leave. We have seen successful reactivations for students who request the leave in advance.

IIRC, people who got employed at Facebook, Microsoft, etc. from Indian universities were started in Canada, and then after a year or so they shifted to the US.

t3_l4wuca,14,Did I unknowingly screw up my chances for OPT after 5 years of studying in the US?,2021-01-25 20:33:58,"I'm afraid I might have messed up my chances for OPT. I might have unknowingly violated some rules. Please read the summary below and give your thoughts, but please don't be harsh especially if you're not sure, I have traumas and get panic attacks when something immigration related might go wrong.

I'm graduating this May (after completing my bachelor's and master's in the US for 5 years total) and  plan to apply for OPT soon. I worked as a Research Assistant on campus during the fall term and now I'm switching to Teaching Assistant for my last semester. This counts as 20 hrs of work, which is the max I can do over the school terms. I get paid a stipend biweekly. Between the fall and spring term my school has like a one month break period (during January) where some people do internships. I've regularly taken advantage of this opportunity and all has been fine. I did the same this year, so I'm currently working 40hrs per week off-campus under CPT. Now, this all sounds fine, except for the fact that for some reason I am still getting paid the stipend during this one month break period (in the first half of the month this is from the RA, the second half would be from the TA). Note that I am not doing any work related to the RA or TA. For most purposes, the RA duties ended when the fall term ended, and the TA stuff hasn't even started yet. But I am still getting paid and that means that I am still officially employed on campus, and looking at my appointments that indeed seems to be the case. Given this internship which is 40hrs/week, it seems like I am working 60 hrs/week on paper which is not allowed for F1 students.

Is this a violation or are those 20 hrs not officially counted? Since the CPT was authorized with no issues, can I assume there isn't a problem?

What are the chances that I am denied OPT for this reason?"

They are offered a part time job near their campus that does not qualify as ""on campus work"". This person thinks that this is on campus work, since it was recommended to him/her by their professor they have collaborated with in the past. Paperwork is filled, and the student gives the HR of this company their SSN, all the relevant documents, including visa, I-94 etc. Everything of this sort is fully accepted by the HR and the student begins their work, thinking they are working on campus, when they are in fact not and actually engaging in illegal unauthorized employment.

\- Summer 2020: home country with family (remember we don't need to take classes during  summertime) 

\- Fall 2021: internship in my home country - approved by my school

&amp;#x200B;

The company I just interned asked me if I could stay and for how long. I told them I could stay until August. My plan was to not take classes during Spring 2021 due to cov19, take 1 online class during Summer 2021 and go back to the United States for Fall 2021 to finish my last semester. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is where I am really confused. There is 2 types of leave of absences: medical and non-medical. Apparently, I would have no issue to take a semester off with a medical leave. However, I am still abroad. What should I do? 

The other option is a non-medical leave of absence but apparently, I will have to be super carefull with the 5 months outside of the U.S issue because I could lose my OPT.

t3_l713tq,0,Applying as a third country national at a country where I used to hold residence,2021-01-28 16:19:22,"I'm an F1 student who's returning to Dubai, UAE, to renew my visa which expired last year on my masters degree. I initially got it for my undergrad at the same university. While I'm technically an Indian passport holder, I was born and raised in Dubai, and since I got my F1 for the first time there, I thought I should also get it renewed there. 

The problem is that I no longer have residency there due to UAE law stating that over-18 boys cannot be sponsored. I haven't held it for four years now, and I'd been returning on a visitor visa to see my parents before the pandemic started. I've also never really lived in India for an extended period of time, only having gone back every now and then for vacations.

My question is this: as a former Dubai expatriate that was born and raised there, got his original F1 visa there, but no longer his residency, is it still advisable for me to try to renew it in Dubai, or should I be renewing in India? My logic is that the visa officer is looking for ties to my country of residence, and as a former resident, I couldn't have stronger ties anywhere else than what I do have in Dubai. I haven't ever lived in India, and I'm not sure the situation there due to the pandemic will improve (I'd be applying at the embassy in Chennai).

If my question is probably better answered by an immigration attorney, I'd appreciate any recommendations you have. This is the first time I'm getting into a pickle like this, and so I'd like to do things the right way as much as possible."

&amp;#x200B;

I know that it says to input ""N/A"" for those fields BUT the pdf has been specifically created to not allow ""/"" character in many of the fields. Can I work around this using half-print, half-typed technique? Is that allowed? Should I do that or should I adhere to the PDF rules they have programmed in?

&amp;#x200B;

My university just says to force fill EVERYTHING with N/A. However, the interpreter and guardian pages are like 2 full pages of N/A for me, should I really flood the pdf with all those N/A?

&amp;#x200B;

Also when it asks for an alien number (or something of that kind) and if I do not have one, do I put ""None"" or ""N/A"" this is also unclear per directions I believe.

For example, original date May 1 to Aug 28 but later on got updated to May 1 to July 28. So should I include both I20 or just the updated one which reflects my actual amount of time I worked?

However, when I reached out to my school HR (people that is in charge of student employments payroll) in regards to these issues, they told me that FICA tax will not be taken out unless I registered for less than 6 credits during that semester. Is that true? Any thoughts?

Please let me know any insight. My F1-OPT ended in August 2020. I decided to apply for a change of status to B2 during my 60day grace period due to the pandemic and because I wasn't sure of the entire situation yet and I am TERRIFIED of covid. I completed the form online and paid the fee to switch to B2. I haven't heard anything yet about the status of this change and I have decided to leave the country. However I just got accepted to a top law school.   

I planned to do a new student visa in my country and return for law school in august 2021. However, I am wondering if I could just switch to F1 again and stay and wait? Will I be able to start law school in fall? I am just nervous about the whole process (getting a visa appt and COVID restrictions) and I am hoping my switch to B2 doesn't affect my visa interview.

t3_lcntuw,4,URGENTLY LOOKING FOR a recent graduate residing in Ohio to join the class action lawsuit against USCIS over the extended delay of issuing OPT receipt notice and approval,2021-02-04 19:30:22,"Hi all, I’m one of the plaintiffs for the class action lawsuit against the USCIS over the extended delay of issuing OPT receipt notice and approval at the Dallas lockbox. As some of you may have heard, many of us have our OPT application documents delivered to the lockbox more than 90 days ago and haven’t heard anything from the USCIS ever since. Therefore, to ensure that we will not lose our legal status and to expedite the review process, we’ve decided to file a class action lawsuit. 

Now we’re looking for a recent graduate who’s also applying for OPT and residing in Ohio to join us as a named plaintiff. The primary responsibilities include filing basic information and paying $50 for case establishment. Either you filed your documents to Arizona or Texas, and either you are applying for initial or STEM OPT, you can help us by joining this lawsuit and we can address this pressing issue together.

Please feel free to reach out to me, and we can discuss more details about it if you’re interested! Thank you for your time!"

t3_lcy1ik,4,How does Potomac service center adjudicate F1 initial OPT applications?,2021-02-05 03:12:11,"Just trying to understand in what order Potomac service center decides applications. My initial OPT application was submitted on November 4 at AZ (payment cashed on 12/10 and got official receipt confirmation on 1/1), and they just started approving November 4 applications this week. However, as I monitor applications with receipt # around mine, I can see that several applications with receipt # below mine get approved, while there is no action on mine, as well as some before mine. For instance, if my receipt # is **190**, I can see **193-202** all getting approved in a bunch, while there's no action on **185-190**. This repeats every day.

Further, if you look at [opttimeline](https://opttimeline.com/), they seem to have started approving applications from November 5th, 6th, and 9th, while hundreds of applications from prior days in November (including mine) and even October remain pending. Isn't this unfair to the people whose applications were submitted earlier?

Lastly, should I be worried that there have been almost 100 applications for November 4, yet mine is not among them? I know I might be sounding paranoid, but I've already pushed my start date twice, and I fear I might end up losing this offer if I have to request any further postponements. 

If u/Codetornado or anyone else has any inputs for me, I would highly appreciate it. Thank You."

She overnighted it to the Dallas lockbox and then found out that she needed to send her application to Chicago instead. She mailed her documents again with a brand new check to Chicago. She’s okay with eating the fee twice but she doesn’t wanna lose her status. Her deadline to apply was February 6, and her second application to Chicago was delivered on the 3rd. Will she be fine?

t3_ldi99k,11,Did not report address change for one of my locations. What are the consequences?,2021-02-05 21:50:55,"I've lived in 3 different locations ever since the beginning of my status. I reported all but one of them. When I moved from the first location to the second, I didn't report the address change to SEVIS. The first location was a permanent location (family member's house) whereas the second location was a temporary one (apartment). I got plenty of important documents addressed to previous tenants and I didn't want any of my important documentation to be wrongly delivered to the apartment after I'd moved out so I maintained the first location's address. That way, I could pick  up important letter without worrying about it being accessed by some stranger.

&amp;#x200B;

I then moved from the second location to a third permanent location. I reported the address change to SEVIS. So SEVIS/USCIS sees location 1 to location 3. The address of the second location most likely shows up in background checks and whatnot. The address was also on my driver's license until it expired and then renewed with the 3rd location's address (current). So the information is out there.

&amp;#x200B;

My questions are:

&amp;#x200B;

1. How does this impact CPT/OPT applications?
2. How does this impact H1B applications?
3. How does this impact Family-Based AOS? (Probably not related to this sub but figured why not)
4. How deep does USCIS go into verifying your CPT/OPT applications, for example? 
5. Is this ground for inadmissibility/removal/unlawful stay accrual?
6. I understand that the law is written to cover potentially all cases but agencies like USCIS have the right to interpret it (where ambiguity permits) as they deem fit and to even deny an applicant for any reason. Given that, how likely is it that it does become an issue?

1. 1a or 1c if you've done Post-Completion OPT in your bachelors and are doing it again for your masters. I've looked at various school's sample I-765's and instructions and some say to tick 1a and other say to tick 1c. I'm curious because this is my Master OPT, I did Post-Completion OPT after my Bachelors and received an EAD hence my confusion. I know I should ask my ISO about this, and I have but I'm yet to hear back so I thought I'd ask here as well. 
2. A-Number or I-94 number on back of the passport photo's. My school's instructions say I-94 but the I-765's instructions say A-Number.  Maybe I should just write both? 
3. In my undergrad, we were told to write our I-94 on the first page of every I-20. My current school has no such instruction. 
4. I-765 says to include previous I-20's that have CPT or OPT authorization. School's instruction says to include ALL previous I-20's. Should I stick to the letter of the I-765 or does my school have inside knowledge that I should consider?"

I've had to take an extended medical leave from my PhD studies, which is allowed for 12 months under a Reduced Course Load. I had hoped to return this semester, but due to circumstances, I still don't have any funding to take classes this semester - and I don't even know how I would be able to pay $12K out of pocket. My university isn't very cooperative on the matter, but I'd really like to find out what else I can do to maintain my status - I seriously can't go back to my home country until I can get new funding, because I have absolutely nothing left there. My life and all the people close to me are here.

I've used up the normally allotted 12 months of medical leave, and I can't figure out how I could petition (or not at all) for an exception so that I can also take this semester to fully get back on my feet. If I can just make it until the end of this semester, then I should be okay because my visa allows me to work in Spring/Summer, and I've got hopes for receiving funding per Sept.

I am an international student and I have secured an internship with a company in the US for this summer. Part of the onboarding process for my internship will require the Form I-9 to be filled. I am aware that I will need to use my passport, Form I-94 and my I-20 with CPT endorsement to verify my identity and work authorization. I will have to mention the issuing authorities for my respective document. My questions is: who do I list as the issuing authority for I-94 and for my I-20 with CPT endorsement?

So I have been an F1 student for roughly 4 years now. I am currently on OPT. I stupidly never knew F1 needs to file taxes!? I know this is really stupid but no one has told me about this and none of my fellow F1 friends have ever filed either! I want to fix this asap. 

Some info - I have been working for the most part, but only part time. Making NOT EVEN $5,000/year. 

Only recently that I’ve started my OPT (June 2020) that I’ve started earning more than $12,000. 

I have some questions: 
1. How fucked am I? 
2. Can I amend this and file backwards? 
3. What the heck do I use (software etc)?"

t3_ljb2hk,158,Tax Question Megathread,2021-02-13 22:35:42,"**All Tax Questions go here.**
&gt;Do I need to pay my 2021 taxes?

No, tax filing now is for the calendar year 2020 and started February 12, 2021, and ends April 15, 2021. 

&gt;Do I have to pay/file/submit taxes?

Yes, all F-1 visa holders regardless of employment or not need to file their taxes.  

If you worked in 2020 you received tax documents from your employer (likely a [W2](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-w-2) or a 1099 of some sort). You will need that form(s). You also need to file a [form 8843](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f8843.pdf). If this is you continue on to the next question.

If you did not work then you need to file a [form 8843](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f8843.pdf) That is all that you must do if you otherwise did not work or receive taxable payments.

&gt;Can I use Turbo tax or another program to file my taxes?

Yes, but you need to find out if you are a ""Resident for Tax Purposes"" or a ""Non-Resident For Tax Purposes"". You can find the questionnaire [here](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/determining-alien-tax-status)

Alternatively, you can go to [Sprintax.com](https://www.sprintax.com) sign up for their program and use the tax determination questionnaire at the beginning of their software. You do not need to pay to use this portion of their software.

If you are deemed a non-resident for tax purposes and you like their software you can continue to use it for your taxes and pay them for convenience. If you want another option there is [Glacier tax Prep](https://www.glaciertax.com) Both of these companies specialize in Non-Resident Taxes. You can also just complete the 1040NR

If you are deemed a resident for tax purposes you can use any other tax software designed for an American. Such as turbo tax, Tax Slayer, etc.

&gt;I was deemed a ""Resident for Tax Purposes"" am I now eligible for permanent resident benefits? 

No. That's why it says, ""Resident for tax purposes"". You are not an actual resident of the US and your immigration status has not changed. You are just now given more flexibility with your taxes and qualify for some additional tax benefits you didn't otherwise qualify for before. That said, you also have more tax liability now compared to before.

It is 100% seperate from your immigration status and does not, can not, and has not granted you any sort of permanent residency in any way shape or form.


&gt;I got a 1098-T, can I use it?

You can only use a 1098-T if you are a Resident for Tax Purposes. Otherwise, it does not apply to you.

&gt;I have Dependents on F2

You need to file your taxes based on the above and file an 8843 for each dependent.

&gt;My spouse on their own F1 needs to file

Have them follow the procedure above and file their own taxes separately.

&gt;My friend got a refund and I had to pay

That happens, there are many reasons it could happen. Taxes are VERY individual. It is possible your friend also filed using the incorrect status Resident vs. Non-Resident etc. You also could have filed wrong. If you are concerned, then use the software linked above to get an answer. If you are still confused after that contact the software provider for support.

&gt;I/my friend/my lover/ the neighbor/my uncle Muhammed Lee got a covid-19 stimulus check? Should that have happened?

Maybe, if you/they were a resident for tax purposes in 2019 or earlier and filed their taxes correctly, they were eligible for the automatic stimulus checks. If they were not a resident for tax purposes in 2019 then they filed their taxes wrong and should not have received the check. They need to return the money and refile their taxes correctly. Sprintax has several blogs with more information about this and how to refile.

 [What should I do to fix this Blog Post: May 14, 2020](http://blog.sprintax.com/filed-as-resident-left-us-received-stimulus-check)         

&gt;How do I use tax form 1099-A/M/J/L/Misc

You can use the tax software above to file your taxes or follow the instructions on the 1040-NR for non-residents or 1040/1040-EA for Residents

&gt;When do I get my refund?

If you are eligible for a refund you must submit your application as a non-resident via the mail to the IRS on/before April 15 (update now it is May 17, 2022) and will receive the refund in July-October. If you elect to have it be a direct deposit, please list your valid US bank account. If you want a check, give them a mailing address where you will be later this Fall.

Residents and Non-Residents who can file electronically can receive the refund in a few business days depending on how you filed your taxes. Via the mail, it takes several weeks. If you elect to have it be a direct deposit, please list your valid US bank account. If you want a check, give them a mailing address where you will be later this summer.

I don't know where I will be in the Fall/Summer or I am leaving the U.S. this Spring/Summer!  Ask a friend you trust to use their mailing address.

&gt;Can I file my non-resident taxes online?

Yes, but e-filing can be limited by the online filing services. 

&gt;I do not have a Social Security Number (SSN) Can I file taxes? 

Yes, but if you are not filing only the 8843 then you need an ITIN or an SSN. 

You can get an ITIN using Spritnax (for an additional fee) or via a private company using the [Acceptance Agent Program](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/acceptance-agent-program) (for a fee) or you cans schedule an appointment with the IRS at one of the [IRS Taxpayer Assistance Centers](https://www.irs.gov/help/tac-locations-where-in-person-document-verification-is-provided) to both submit your taxes and the ITIN request form in person at one of their offices for free. You will need to call, schedule an appointment and bring all completed documents to the office for the submission of the ITIN request and submitting your other tax forms. If you use one of the software above as a non-resident then you can print and bring the documents from that software to their office."

* International student under F1 visa 
* Graduate STEM student (Master in Computer Science) 
* Started my Master in Fall 2018 (add to take 2 extra semesters because of my ug major) 

&amp;#x200B;

**Reason of my leave of absence:** 

I took a non-medical leave of absence since this semester (Spring 2021) and I am currently working on my home country. The reason of my leave of absence is mostly because I got a full-time job offer in my home country and the situation was still not great in the U.S due to cov-19, I also wanted to make a bit of money and experience before to come back to the US. 

* Program extension accepted until May 2022
* Non-medical leave of absence accepted for Spring 2021 (Summer is not considerer as a real semester for them and I said I will be back in Fall 2021). 

&amp;#x200B;

**What I am not sure about...** 

The International Student office of my university told me few things:

\- I must be enrolled for a full-time year (fall + spring) in order to be eligible for the OPT. If I am taking online classes this summer + on-ground classes in Fall 2021, I may not get it? 

\- Would it be possible to postpone by 1 more year my degree as long as I still have 2 more semesters left or I may be kick out by my university?"

Long story short, here's my current situation:

1. I sent my I-765 + extra to USCIS (Chicago lockbox )a few days before my 60-day grace period ended.   
To be precise, my grace period ended 2/16 and the Chicago lockbox received my application 2/15 via FedEx. (I know I should've sent it before graduation! But there's nothing I can do about that at this point). 
2. The start-date for my new job is the last week of April, which gives me around 2 months before being authorized 

Should I be concerned about employment authorization not being approved before the start-date for my new job? If so, by how long should I ask my new employer to push back the start-date?

Should I be concerned about my 60-day grace period having ended before I-765 receipt is sent out? Or is it okay as long as the Chicago lockbox received my documents before the end of the grace period?

Thank you so much! I'm panicking a little bit and any advice or help would be greatly, greatly appreciated."

So my questions are:

1. Can I still resubmit the application? My EAD already expired a month ago by now.
2. I have been working as usual after submitting my application because according to my DSO, USCIS is currently not sending out 'received application' notice and as long as it is timely filed, it should be ok. Of course I did not know back then that my application would be rejected, but now that it is rejected, can I still continue to work (assuming I can resubmit)? 
3. If I cannot resubmit, would there be a problem in entering the US in the future due to unauthorized work?
4. If I can resubmit, do I need to ask for new I-20? I found conflicting information about this, with some saying the I-20 that has the STEM OPT recommendation would work for 30 days and some 60 days.

t3_lqv93f,4,SEVIS Fee expired,2021-02-23 22:44:23,"Hi all, 

I have a quick question. I was accepted to a grad-school last year for fall 2020

I paid my SEVIS Fee in May 2020 hoping to go for an interview a couple of months later. That didn't happen due to the pandemic, and now I'm joining the same school, the same program in Fall 2021. My i20 for Fall 2021 has the same SEVIS ID. 

My previously paid SEVIS Fee expires in May 2021. I'm hoping to take an interview appointment in July 2021. Would I need to re-pay the SEVIS fee? Can I do that? Has anyone faced this before?"

t3_lr7jcb,4,Dropped CPT course,2021-02-24 08:21:05,"I interned with a company this summer and received a CPT from my school for the internship. The CPT was granted on the basis that I take a specific class I was enrolled in for in the fall semester after that summer. However, I dropped out of that course mid semester because of reasons. I didn’t realize I made a mistake until I emailed my dso about getting another CPT for winter intersession. She informed me that I did not qualify for winter intersession because I did not take that class for my summer internship. 

I tried to get a departmental recommendation to try to attach that CPT with another course I had taken during fall but my DSO is not sure if that will fix this problem. 

My question is now that I am applying for OPT, is there a chance my OPT application will be denied? Has anyone faced a problem like this? How can I try to fix it?"

I know that the 5-month rule is suspended for the spring 2021 semester, but I don't understand if this means the 5-month rule is suspended from the beginning of the spring semester or from the end of the spring semester. i.e., considering the Spring semester started in Jan 2021 and ends in May 2021, am I allowed to stay outside the US until only May 2021 (5 months from start date) or can I stay in my country for the summer break and return at the start of the Fall 2021 semester while maintaining active F1 status?"

As many here I sent my application to the TX lockbox in November. After not hearing a response (no receipt no cashed check) for months, I decided to cancel my first i-20 and re-apply at the Chicago lockbox. Two days after my application was received at Chicago, my check was cashed. A week later, my original check (from my cancelled application in TX)  was cashed at the Chicago lockbox. I don't feel it is fair that they charged me for the cancelled i-20 application due to their horrible backlog. Is there any way I can recover the fee ?

I sent my i-765 for my initial OPT on Feb 9, and it was delivered on Feb 12. It will be two weeks since it was delivered. There is no charge on my credit card and I didn't hear from USCIS. I saw people in this forum got their money order cashed and charge on credit card within a week. 

I'm afraid that they will take it too long and it will exceed 30 days after the i-20 is issued. (If there is something wrong with the credit card or form G1450, how do I know this?)

Should I send a new application? I try to contact my credit card company, all I can do is freeze the account, but I don't know for how long I should freeze it to prevent the transaction.

So I've submitted 2 applications for STEM OPT on November 25 and January 13 due to me forgetting to sign the I-20 on my first application. The I20s for both applications are the same.
I got my receipt number for the first application last week and my DSO emailed Potomac my revised I-20.
I also called my bank to put a stop payment on my second check and withdrawed almost all my money from the account so USCIS transaction will be declined.

My questions are:
1. If my 2nd application got rejected will it affect my first application processing at Potomac?

2. I know that we're not supposed to send in duplicate, but if one is received and the other one is rejected, will I still need to send letter for withdrawal later on?

3. A lot of people who used check got their check processed and case received notification but later on will change to application/petition rejected due to insufficient funds. Is that the same as case rejected?

t3_lsqoqk,1,Pre-completion opt eligibility,2021-02-26 05:20:01,"Hi guys, I’m a fashion model studying MBA major in entrepreneurial studies. My school offers CPT through the Coop program but I don’t qualify for CPT if I want to model because fashion models are classified as independent contractors. 

So since I’m planning on leaving the US after graduation I’ve been considering applying for pre-completion opt so I could model since you’re allowed to work for hire under opt. However, my DSO won’t sign my I-20 cause:
1. She said I can get pre-completion opt only if CPTs not an option. So I should look into other jobs which I can easily get CPT approval. Problem is I really wanna model. 
2. She doesn’t see the how fashion modeling is related to my major even after trying to convince her to see it as entrepreneurial activity because there’s an element of self-employment and I’ve been taking marketing classes and modeling is essentially marketing. 

I get that she doesn’t want any problems for the school but also think they’re not trying to see it as unique situation since they mostly deal with approving corporate jobs rather than creatives. So I just want to know if there’s any way to convince or counter her arguments. I want to seek legal advice but don’t want to spend money I barely have.

However, my passport doesn't mention X and shows my place of birth as Y. Y is actually a sub-region inside X. 

To complicate matters, my ""state of birth"" has changed due to redrawing of boundaries.

In the additional information section, I've written ""My place of birth is X (on passport) which is located in the city of Y (on i20)"" but did not attach any documentation to support this point. Of course, googling Y shows it in X on wiki page.  I've addressed the second point as ""My state of birth has changed due to redrawing of boundaries since issuance of my passport"". Again, no evidence, but Google can give the evidence. All this is public information.

Is this mismatch reason enough for rejection/RFE? I am freaking out. Please suggest if you've faced these issues."

t3_ltblh8,124,OPT Processing Delays Megathread,2021-02-27 00:10:16,"**Welcome to the new OPT Delays Megathread**    
Please see the old thread [here](https://reddit.com/r/f1visa/comments/kxibo0/opt_delays_help_f1_students)

****February 26 Update****    
&gt;[USCIS has announced changes to OPT Processing due to significant delays in processing.](https://www.uscis.gov/news/alerts/uscis-extends-flexibilities-to-certain-applicants-filing-form-i-765-for-opt)

&gt; **14-month OPT Period Flexibilities**   
&gt; F-1 students may participate in up to 12 months of post-completion OPT, which must be completed within 14 months from the end of their program. Due to the delays at the lockbox, some applicants may only be eligible for a shortened period of OPT within that 14-month period. To allow F-1 students to complete the full period of requested OPT (up to 12 months), USCIS will allow the 14-month period to commence from the date of approval of the Form I-765 for applications for post-completion OPT.
&gt; Beginning today, USCIS will approve applications for post-completion OPT with validity dates reflecting the same amount of time originally recommended by the designated school official (DSO) from their school on the Form I-20, Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status.
&gt; F-1 students requesting post-completion OPT who receive an approval of Form I-765 for less than the full amount of OPT time requested (not to exceed 12 months) due to the requirement that the OPT be completed within 14 months of the program end date may request a correction of the EAD due to USCIS error. USCIS will issue a corrected EAD with a new end date, as requested, to cover the full amount of OPT time recommended in the original application.

&gt;**Refiling Following Rejection**     
&gt; Applicants for OPT must file the Form I-765 during certain timeframes. However, we recognize that due to the lockbox delays, some applicants who timely filed Form I-765 for OPT and whose applications were later rejected are unable to timely refile within the required application timeframes.
&gt; USCIS will accept a refiled Form I-765 for OPT and STEM OPT as filed on the original filing date if:
&gt; 
&gt; The original, timely filed application was received on or after Oct. 1, 2020, through May 1, 2021, inclusive; and USCIS subsequently rejected it.
&gt; Refiled applications must be received by May 31, 2021, for USCIS to treat the application as though filed on the original received date.
&gt; Applicants refiling a Form I-765 for OPT or STEM OPT do not need to obtain a new Form I-20 with an updated OPT recommendation from the DSO, as long as they originally submitted an application for post-completion OPT within 30 days of the DSO’s recommendation or an application for STEM OPT within 60 days of the DSO’s recommendation as required by the regulations.
&gt; Applicants refiling an application should include a copy of the rejection notice to facilitate review of the case.
&gt; 

&gt;**Missing or Deficient Signatures**
&gt; Applications with missing or deficient signatures are generally rejected at the lockbox. This policy remains unchanged. However, if the lockbox accepts a Form I-765 application for OPT or STEM OPT with a missing or deficient signature, USCIS will issue a Request for Evidence rather than deny the application, to give the applicant the opportunity to respond and provide the necessary signature or correct the deficiency. We encourage applicants filing Form I-765 to review the form instructions on our website to ensure their application is complete before filing it.
&gt; 

**January 14 Update:**    
&gt; OPT processing has been extremely slow this year due to COVID-19 and staffing shortages. The Dallas, TX lockbox has stopped OPT processing entirely after Oct 29th applications. The Phoenix lockbox is working on late November applications. 
&gt; 
&gt; To track the current status of OPTs in the system, we are using the [OPT tracker](https://opttimeline.com/#ReceiptDateData)
&gt; 
&gt; If you have not yet filled your application, [USCIS has announced that all OPTs need to go to the Chicago lockbox](https://www.uscis.gov/i-765-addresses?fbclid=IwAR1Po7K_XBSA1Ih0lpSPfVHrT71YZ5PrPg_x4uwW-Zt-Zw-p2TBHfG38nvU)

Hope you're doing well and keeping safe. 

I was wondering if anybody here has ideas of companies that would hire or are comfortable with international students as interns specifically in Missouri?

I was hoping to be in contact with people who actually have gone through with the application process and such.

Is there any risk in doing so? I know I am overthinking but what fears me is that the CBP officers will be suspicious of me as I will be entering at the end of the semester.

t3_lx6aud,5,Questions about obtaining F1 visas for Brazilian students,2021-03-03 22:39:33,"Here is the situation. My wife and I are both US citizens. I am natural born and she is naturalized. She has two teenage siblings in Brazil, high school age. Both parents are deceased, so an older brother who lives in Brazil is currently the legal guardian of them. We are looking into the possibility of the two teenage boys coming to the United States to attend high school and possibly college afterward.  We are trying to figure out what our best options are at this point.  Also, we are trying to determine if it is feasible for us to complete the process without having to hire an immigration attorney.

1. How challenging would it be to get them visas at this point, especially with the pandemic?
2. How hard would it be to get them into public school vs. private school?  I read where F1 students can only attend public school for one year. I know several private schools that have programs for international students, but tuition is pretty steep. If we can get them into public school, that would be much better for us financially.

Let me know if there is anybody who has been through a similar experience that you are willing to share."

I’ve already studied in the US for well over a year so I’m alright for summer break, but I will not be able to pay tuition when my university requests it in mid-august (this is not a hard deadline, my university notoriously does not take action on late payments until the first day of classes). 

However, I should be able to pay in early september, before the 3rd September deadline when late fees begin and will certainly be able to pay before the 10 September deadline when those with outstanding balances are forcibly unenrolled from classes. 

In the interim between mid august and 10 september, during which I would be officially registered for classes despite not having paid tuition, can either the university or USCIS take any action against my visa status?

t3_m0bqom,2,Business Econ Junior feeling lost,2021-03-08 08:59:56,"I really want to stay in the US after graduation, and that means finding an employer who would sponsor me a H1-B, and that means a good resume, and that means having lots of internship experience preferably at well known companies right?

But I don’t really have any. I have been working part time on campus as an IT analyst and participated as an intern for a project management internship last summer, but that’s about it. I have been applying for this coming summer but haven’t gotten back any replies (I’m getting so stressed considering it’s March already and chances are getting slimmer each day goes by). I feel like if I don’t secure one for this summer, it just makes it that much more difficult to secure a job after graduation on my OPT, let alone one that could potentially sponsor me. 

I’m also confused as to what kind of internships I can apply (provided we can only do the ones directly related to our majors as F-1 visa holders). I go to UC Davis and my major is Managerial Economics, with a Minor in Computer Science. Per UC Davis, the definition of a managerial economics degree is as follows:

&gt;	Managerial Economics goes beyond the limits of traditional economics and business majors, blending a thorough grounding in economic theory with business knowledge and applications. The program provides in-depth exposure to economics and quantitative methods, problem-solving strategies, critical thinking and effective communication skills. Options for specialization include: business economics, international business economics, environmental and resource economics, and agribusiness economics.

This is so broad that I don’t know what internships are even eligible for my visa status that I fear would jeopardise my future in the US. Having said that, I should let y’all know that this degree recently changed to be classified as a STEM designation, so I would in theory have 1+2 years in my OPT. Still, it’s no reason to start slacking as it really beats me down seeing my friend securing her SDE internship at Amazon.

Anyone has ANY advice for me please let me know, I’m at an all time low now and would love to make it in this country :("

t3_m1p0uf,6,F1 visa day trading,2021-03-10 04:11:14,"Hi All,

I need advice or evaluation of my current situation.

I am an international F1 visa student in one of the top US universities.

I installed Binance about ten days ago, only out of sheer curiosity. I put $100 on Bitcoin initially and got $110 by the end of the day, which made me greedy, and I put $1000 the day after. In two days, I already had $3000 in my portfolio. I was entirely new to the cryptocurrency market and did not get used to the volatility and dips, so when the price went down, I sold everything, and when it went up, I rebought everything back.

After about a week of trading in this manner, I lost about $100 and have about 80 transactions in trade history. Partially, this is because I used stop-limit orders that were split into two or three smaller (and tiny) parts.

By now, I realized that it is not for me, and I don't want to keep trading like that.

However, I read from some sources that F1 students are not allowed to day trading. I have 80 trades in 10 days, so it is more than enough to consider me as a day trader now. I did it for only nine days. I started on 02/28, and the last time I bought BTC yesterday, 03/08, my gain is negative. Am I in trouble? Should I expect any problems with my F1 visa status?"

My uncle who lives in the US will be sponsoring me, he sent me his bank statement which meets the minimum financial requirements for admission to the university so I applied with it, but he recently told me that he withdrew most of the money from his bank account.

What kind of information are banks allowed to disclose when a university wants to verify a bank statement?"

t3_m55o6g,1,Leave of Absence and reentering US with F-2,2021-03-14 22:12:20,"Hi All.

Asking for a friend.

If he is currently on F-1 visa and wants to take a leave of absence (LOA) from school for one year, can he apply for F-2 visa during his LOA and come back to the US on F-2 visa as his spouse will be an active F-1 student during that period? 

On a side note: he heard that it is possible to reenter as a tourist with B-2 visa but is unsure about F-2 (assuming that he will need to cancel his F-1 visa first before applying for F-2 as double F status is not allowed and then when going back to school, he will need to cancel F-2 and reapply for F-1).

If so, is he required to leave the US and then reenter with F-2 or the ""F-1 to F-2"" documentation can be processed in the US too?

Thank you."

I know that taking advantage of government “handouts” can lead to a denial of a permanent resident application. Does that apply to us as well, because the actual beneficiary is a US citizen.

This racial-discrimination Trump Proclamation unfairly targets innocent students with Chinese origins specifically could cause almost all the new incoming Chinese International Students’ F1 visa rejected.

I am in the last semester of my degree as an F1 student. I crossed at a land border from Canada to the US back in January with my I20 and requested F1 status. I checked my i94 status after I arrived and it was not updated (it showed F1 status from when I previously entered the US in July 2020). My school official told me that it can take a while to update. It is now several months later and still not updated (but my travel history shows that I crossed into the US in January). Upon calling many different phone numbers and field offices, apparently during covid the US land borders are not updating i94's and immigrants have to request and pay for one before entering the US. Additionally, they told me that there is no way to request a new i94 while I am currently in the US. One of the border officers that I called said that I would have entered on my previous i94 as that is still valid.

The internship experience was counted towards my 3 credits as well. The DSO made an error in recording my part-time CPT as a Full-time CPT.

Side Note: From what I can see from ICE website, you're not allowed to work full time while enrolled as full-time student.. its a violation of F1 rules

I brought this to the attention of DSO in March 2021 who spoke to SEVP about a possible correction. They informed the DSO that they cannot backdate the corrections and that DSO should attach a letter explaining what happened.

I've attached the explanation by DSO on college letterhead, my unofficial transcript (showing full-time enrollment), my offer letter clearly stating ""no more than 20 hours a week"" and biweekly paystubs (showing my hours) as well proving that even though I was approved for Full-Time CPT on paper (on error), I'd worked as per F1 regulations (less than 20 hours a week). My DSO says it's recorded on my SEVIS under ""Events"" whenever they had a conversation with DHS.

Posting here again because my DSO... anyways. 

I am currently filing for OPT and on the webinars / guidelines the school provided, there is no mention of CPT whatsoever. I guess I’m just overly anxious about this process and been looking too much online , but did any of you / do we have to mention previous CPTs?

So here is my situation, I am on an f1 visa with OPT EAD card and there is a set deadline by April first week by which I need to start employment (work date) by. I have officially accepted a position at the company through a staffing agency. I may/may not get a better offer that is permanent through another company with a better offer practically a week or two later that is outside of my opt work to date.

So by accepting the first contract with lower pay position, I would be able to extend my opt status and if I get the other offer (with better pay and benefits), I would like to quit my first contract and leave for the company with a better offer.

Would it be wise to do something like this where I would leave the job quite literally in 2-3 weeks if end up getting the better offer? I wanted to know your opinions. Is the contract binding? I don't see anywhere in the agreement that it is binding.

Would I put myself in a bad situation by doing this?

I am having trouble and possibly doubts on how some employments may be related to my field. 

I am applying for regular OPT and my degree is cybersecurity. My DSO tells me its somewhat difficult for F1 students to apply for jobs related to this field because they need US citizenship or some sort security clearance, which can be challenging for F1s. 

So in the interest to anticipate , and avoid adding days of unemployment; I wanted to ask my current on campus employer if they could give me classes relating to cybersecurity(IT classes or Programming for cyber classes ).

Let me explain what I do, I am a Notetaker/Scribe/Reader/assistant in my school's disability department. I assist visually or hearing impaired students with their classes. Essentially I read, re-explain, produce notes; in general I assist the student to facilitate their learning experience. 

I asked my DSO about this and he replied me with, Could you explain to USCIS how this job related to my field? 

Now that I think about it and taking into consideration the accommodation of my employer, I can successfully explain (at least on my part) how this employment relates. 

However, due to some anxiety building up on me, I wanted to ask other people, what do you think about this ?"

t3_mikm6n,23,F1 Visa Renewal with Interview Waiver,2021-04-02 13:41:31,"Hello, I have an F1 visa that will expire in June and I am currently visiting my home country until the end of April. Since I am back to my home country for a month, I tried to renew my visa. I have submitted my DS160 and paid the MRV fee. Thankfully, I was given an interview waiver and my instruction was to send my documents along with my passport to the consulate. 

I just wanted to ask your opinion on something: Currently, I am thinking of not sending my documents and go back to USA with my current visa because I am not sure if my passport would be returned to me by the end of April. 

I have called the consulate and they said that they cannot guarantee any processing times but it is usually 10 business days. However, they said that visa officer has the right to call the applicant for an interview if he/she finds it necessary. If that happens, they told me that I would need to arrange an appointment and apparently those appointments are given for a year later (for example, students who are submitting their forms now are able to set up an appointment in March 2022). 

Therefore, I am very afraid that my visa application will not be resolved on time and my visa will expire before I have a chance to renew it. 

With all these considerations, I am thinking of going back to USA at the end of April and see if consulates go back to their regular processings and come back to my country later to renew the visa if they return to their regular operations. 

My home country is Turkey, but irregardless of your home country, I wanted to ask if anybody had any experience with F-1 renewal with interview waiver and what would you suggest me doing?"

t3_mmvqzg,13,F1 violation of status: Reinstatement vs. new I-20,2021-04-08 16:38:42,"Hello everyone!

I got myself into a tricky situation. I am pursuing my PhD in the US and nearing my defense. However, I had numerous extensions to my I-20 due to slow progress (it took me a while to get to the final lap...). Anyways, last summer my I-20 expired and forgot to request extension before the expiration date of August/20/2020. University caught it when I needed work authorization (for TA duty and funding) for the fall quarter, just in time before the 2 month grace period. We quickly scrambled together a plan to apply for OPT (with my masters Degree), so I can stay in the US and work towards my dissertation (I did not need to be officially enrolled, as I was given access to my lab) and then once ready they were going to reinstate (not I-20 reinstatement) me into the PhD program.  The other option was to travel out of the country and obtain new I-20 and reenter a quarter later, which I chose not to do because of the whole pandemic situation, which was really bad in the Fall and Winter and mostly because I wouldn't have been able to work towards my dissertation. And with one day before the grace period ended I submitted my application to USCIS with next day delivery!

All good, but with all the stress, I made the silliest mistake: forgot to sign my application. Letter came a month later saying I was denied due to lack of signature. I quickly signed it and resubmitted hoping it will pass, but in late February 2021 I got another rejection letter, saying ""my properly filed application"" was sent after the grace period. 

So at the beginning of the spring quarter the school's Internationl office tells me I am out of status and I just had a quick zoom meeting with preliminary advisor, who mentioned the date March 1st and that I am out of status. I am having longer appointment tomorrow with another advisor, and I already know the 2 options and it seems like lots of people in this thread are having the same dilemma. 

I am aware of the requirements for reinstatement: 1) Not being more than 5 months out of status, 2) not having ""repeated or willful violations of immigration regulations"". I have few questions:

1) What would be the date that I am out of status from? End of grace period? First OPT rejection?

2) the requirement ""The violation of status resulted from circumstances beyond your control."": It seems like the violation happened because of my 2 mistakes, so seems like I don't qualify?

3) ""repeated or willful violations of immigration regulations"": the only violation I have done in the past is lose my I-20 once, and travel without signature couple times (though I travelled many more before that and wasn't stopped at the border, which made me think it's not an issue). Does this count as violation?

4) I read on this forum that I need to be enrolled while waiting for reinstatement. Since the spring quarter has already started, I might not be able to be enrolled. Would that extend the 5 month out-of-status period? I'd rather not have to be enrolled without I-20 because then I cannot receive funding for TAing and have to pay huge sums to be enrolled just so I can be writing my dissertation.

5) My plan was to graduate this summer and start working sometime in the Fall. However, with, the second option of travelling to Mexico and entering with a new I-20, I am afraid that makes me unable to use my OPT for another year and on top of that if I graduate, I still won't be able to have I-20 status.

Oh, and if it matters, at least my Visa is valid till 2024 and my passport till 2022.

Thank you for reading! Do you think I have a chance at reinstatement? I really would like not to have to   wait a year till having a job."

Got my DSO request a data fix, it was approved by SEVP. Returned to the states, but didn't make it back to school due to not getting the testing kit for some stupid reasons. That's not all. DSO failed to register my sevis into the system, and my record was automatically terminated due to 'no-show'. 

Contacted SEVP, and a rep said that a data-fix should do the work. DSO kept saying that leaving the country is the only option.

Up till now and even months from now, my country will not allow people to get back in.

t3_moy7vq,4,Question about having my name on a GoFundMe,2021-04-11 20:05:23,"Hello,

I’m an international sophomore at a US college. For one of my college clubs, I’m the finance chair, so our fundraisers, which were done through GroupMe, were deposited into the club’s bank account under my name, as I’m a co-signer. To clarify, this isn’t a co-signer for a loan, just someone who’s in charge of the account, I believe. Also, the GoFundMe isn’t for myself, it’s just fundraising for the club’s events. I don’t have a Social Security Number yet, so I couldn’t authorize the GoFundMe deposit into my account. So, someone else in the club did the deposit using her information, but in the bank statement, it says the receiving individual is me. I haven’t received the money in my personal bank account, it’s deposited in the club’s bank account, just with my name on the statement. My questions are:

1. Are international students allowed to be co-signers for a college club’s bank account?

2. Is it okay for the receiving individual of the GoFundMe to be me, as I don’t have an SSN?

Thanks!

Edit: Added clarification that I’m not talking about a loan. I think in this context, being a co-signer just means I’m in charge of the bank account, and that the GoFundMe isn’t for me, it’s just for general club events that had nothing to do with me except for having my name on it."
t3_mp4xmh,4,Paranoid about not receiving the mail with EAD,2021-04-12 02:24:45,"I have post-completion OPT application in progress and I'm soon expected to move to another state. I used a friend's address (in a third different state) for physical mailing purposes because my address is unstable in the next few months. I've successfully received the receipt at the friend's address, but I'm really paranoid about the physical EAD that's supposed to come later (if it's approved).

 Assuming the friend gets the mail, then they need to mail it to me. I'm yet to get a place, but a lot of places I'm considering to lease (which are otherwise great) seem to have issues with stolen mail and packages. So I'm really freaked out what will happen if I don't get the mail with the EAD. I read something about how USCIS will generate a new card if it's USPS fault, but that doesn't apply. 

What would be my options in this case? Would I just have to reapply and wait another 3-5 months? This is hardly going to work for me as I'll lose my job and will have to break the lease. I'm looking for all other options here.

Also, isn't the physical EAD the easy part of the whole application, as it's a matter of printing a piece of paper? Wouldn't USCIS be able to just reprint it, maybe for some large fee (to incentivize people to not lose it, while not completely ruining one's plans because of a logistical mistake the person had barely control over)?"

t3_mq3lmw,3,F1 visa for masters after doing undergrad in US - chances of getting a second F1 approved?,2021-04-13 14:39:42,"I came here on F1 from the UK in 2014 and did my undergrad. Graduated in 2018 and have spent the last 3 years doing my STEM OPT. My OPT expires next month and I plan on heading back to England to see my family before starting my masters program in the fall. I got accepted at a good university in the US - top program for a one year masters followed by six months global internship overseas.

My concern after reading online is F1 visa rejection because I’ve already been here since 2014, done OPT, heading home when the EAD expires and then coming back in the fall for Graf school. I feel like it could look suspicious? I don’t intend to stay once i head out on the global internship but I’m concerned if I get rejected it might be safer to accept at a UK University even if it’s not as prestigious.

Does anyone have advice or has anyone been In a similar situation?"

t3_mr26rx,14,ICE Phone calls : Beware !,2021-04-14 22:57:12,"I’ve posted this on the scam subreddit but I thought it could be useful to my fellow F1 already under a lot of stress. This happened to me  a few hours ago ! So I know someone who is already stressed for their OPT or else could be easily overwhelmed as it was pretty convincing. 

The event : 

I’ve got a call from a number ( same as the one listed on the governmental site) 

THEY KNEW MY NAME  and said I misfiled an Alien Registration number , they said it was a violation of the US Laws. They also said that I should not by any means tell anyone that an ‘on call’ investigation was going on about me and that I should not hang up by any means even after I said I was having a panic attack. 

they then asked me to go on ice.gov and check the number to confirm their identity ( it was the same number as they used to call me) , they told me to check my rights and that I was on surveillance.


another number called me while the call was going on, they said that I was under surveillance and that anyone who called me they would know , they said ‘ a number is calling you why aren’t you picking up’ in order to make the surveillance threat legitimate. 

they asked me to put them on hold and pick the other call, someone else posed as a police officer on their way to arrest me unless I cooperated with the ICE agent. They gave me names and Badge numbers. They called 5 more times when I hung up the phone and wouldn’t pick up anymore. They said I was going to get arrested if I talked about it to anyone or hung up as we talked since it was an ‘ on call’ investigation and that it was recorded. 

The fact that they knew my name definitely spooked me beyond measure , if you get this kind of calls ; DO NOT give them any kind of information, my International office said it happened to a very frightened girl and she gave them SSN/Bank Account numbers. US agencies do NOT call you on your phone to mess with you , neither does the police department. 

Y’all stay safe !"

 My school offers a program where you can take a combined Bachelors/Masters in Cs in 4 years or 4 1/2 yrs or 5 years. I am currently on a full ride so i'd ideally want to finish the masters in 4 years so that I don't have to pay grad tuition that extra semester/year. I'm on track to do so.
My question thus is, if i do the combined bs/ms in 4 years, can my opt for both my bachelors and masters get aggregated together so i'll have about 6 years here and thus more chances at aiming for h1b visas or do i get to only use my Bachelors opt?

I basically wanna work here cause my home country is shit, so from a perspective of maximizing my potential to get an h1b visa, is it wise to do the masters concurrently/immediately after or utilise my bachelor opt first, try out h1b visa the three years, if it doesn't work out, go do the masters in an year then qualify for 3 more years opt?

I am considering using that instead of paper application to save time. Has anyone done this so far? My specific worry is that in the paper application of I-765, they have a section to list all your past CPT information (which matters as they need to make sure that you have not done more than a year of CPT). However, there is no place to input that information in the online version of the form. I am guessing that if they designed the online form this way, then it probably should be alright. But it seems weird and I am wondering if I am not just making a mistake (in case I still need to somehow put that information somewhere).

EDIT : Okay, so I realized that there is actually a section within ""Evidence"" in which one can upload ""evidence of post-completion CPT or OPT."" I perhaps missed that because  it said ""post-completion"" and I thought I would not have anything for that yet as I am only now completing. But it is just a badly named section and it asks for ""evidence of any previously authorized CPT or OPT"". I am not sure what counts as evidence though."

I went to study at a university back in 2019 as an undergrad for a semester abroad program. I was issued an F-1 visa for the purpose. I came back in January 2020 and now I go back to the same university as a grad student and my visa is still valid (hasn't expired; will be expiring in 2024). I will get a fresh I-20. Keeping in mind the five-month rule and the fact that I'll be a grad student now, do I need to re-apply for a visa and go through the visa interview process, etc.?"

I am planning to go back to Italy for a month in June, and it is not clear to me if I can come back to the US due to the [travel ban](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/25/proclamation-on-the-suspension-of-entry-as-immigrants-and-non-immigrants-of-certain-additional-persons-who-pose-a-risk-of-transmitting-coronavirus-disease/) (01/25/2021).

I found a recent [post](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/News/visas-news/national-interest-exceptions-from-certain-travelers-from-the-schengen-area-uk-and-ireland.html) (03/02/2021) from the state department that appear to exempt F1 students that already have a visa, but nobody in the international students office could give me a straight answer.

1. What materials are required for the CPT application? I know a letter from the company is required that states the start and end date of the internship, but I don’t know what else is required.

2. I will be enrolling in the required internship course (for course credit) in the fall semester, but enrollment hasn’t started for that yet. How would I show that I plan on taking the course? Is it enough to just say that I will take it?

3. Who do I hand the letter from the company (and other required documents) to? Is it my college’s international studies office or do I send it to the immigration agency?

I have started the process for getting a loan sanctioned but the bank would take quite some time. I need to get my i20 from the college.

Is it okay to show personal funds as the source of funding doe the i20 and later for the VISA when required show the loan as source of funding. It's just that if I wait for the loan to be sanctioned and show that as the proof, getting an i20 would two another 2 weeks and I would be significantly delayed for the VISA process.

Im a med student on a F1 visa and I’ll be doing my residency on a J1. I recently discovered that adjusting status takes 6-12 months and I need to be able to work by June 17. I should’ve applied for OPT back in march but I didn’t know adjusting status took so long and just assumed that going into the J1 was easier. I believe my
options now are:

1) submit online OPT and pray it gets approved in 2 months (which apparently some people that did the online OPT got approved 6 days - 2 weeks)

2) go back to home country and get the J1 there (embassy is only open for emergency appointments so I don’t know how quickly this would work)

t3_myagok,2,Parent on F1 visa,2021-04-25 15:23:41,"Hello. I'll be applying for F1 visa in a few days. I have been accepted to a undergrad university in the US and my undergrad will last for 4 years. For my parents and sibling, we will be applying for B2 multiple entry visa so that they can come and visit me once in a year or so, for vacation. I have heard that if a student will be attending a US university on a F1 visa, he/she can bring one parent on the F1 visa. And if this is the case, there is no need for that parent to apply for B2 multiple entry visa. Only the other parent and the sibling would have to apply for the B2 visa if they wish to visit the US during those 4 years of undergrad. To what extent is that true? Please note, the parent on the F1 visa won't be the payer or the sponsor and won't be staying with me for my 4 years of undergrad. They will come and visit the US once in a year or so. Is there a minimum number of days that the parent on the F1 visa will have to stay in the US with their child for continuing the validity of the F1 visa? Does that parent have to visit the US a certain number of times during those 4 years- whether monthly or yearly? Are there any other rules or requirements that the F1 visa parent will have to fulfill to continue their visa validity.  Can the parent on F1 visa and the other parent and sibling on B2 visa travel together when they visit the US? Also, the parent on the F1 visa will only be able to stay in the US for 15 days or 1 month max. with the other parent and sibling. 

Also, for B2 multiple entry visas, is there a minimum no. of days the other parent and the sibling must stay in the US or any certain no. of times they need to come to the US throughout the 4 years of undergrad, to continue the validity of the B2 visas? Is it fine if they come to the US just once in a year or so and stay in the US for 15 days or 1 month? Do they need an invitation letter or some other document from the university or the student to visit the US?"

    2018 - 1month - USMLE exam and to visit my friend. Actual plan was to stay for 2 weeks but it was December and my flight got canceled  due to the weather, so i had to stay for 2 weeks extra till my next flight was available in 2 nd week of jan
   2020- 3months -  entirely for visiting friends and one of them was having a nervous  breakdown due to loosing  family members to Covid. 

3. I was given an opportunity  to go for a vocational  training in 2018 through University of Florida. And applied for F1 visa through the US embassy in Abudhabi and it was Rejected due to insufficient documents from the university. I wasn't given a slip saying anything. They told me to contact my university.

5. I am paying for my studies through a student loan I have taken.

I have taken the TOEFL exam and gotten a 113.

Now my F1 visa interview is in August and it is worrying me that I wont be able to start my program in the fall due to a visa denial. I have literally waited 4 years to pursue my masters.

t3_n1d4p8,2,How long does it take to process OPT application WITHDRAWAL?,2021-04-29 20:14:27,"I really really messed up my OPT application.

Due to misinterpretation of university guidelines and some haste/ignorance, I applied for OPT online and uploaded my regular I-20 instead of my post completion I-20. In fact, I don't even have a post completion I-20 yet (this is where the misinterpretation of uni guidelines comes in).

Anyway, after realizing the blunder, I spoke to DSO and USCIS.

DSO said the best course of action is cancelling/withdrawing the application.

USCIS gave me mixed responses - 2 of them said I can mail the correct I-20 with a letter explaining the mistake. Another official told me they won't accept any docs mailed separately and the application will be rejected.

To buy myself time and avoid risks, I extended my program to the summer and wrote to USCIS asking for withdrawal of my I-765 application (enclosed the receipt as well).

Does anyone know how long USCIS will take to cancel my application so that I can plan my next steps? Potomac center's processing time shows 5.5-7 months, so I'm worried.

Can anybody please give some advise?"

t3_n3q6i5,4,F2 visa questions,2021-05-03 07:13:40,"Hi All :) 

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently an initial status F1 student that can enter the US in mid-July only.

My husband is going back to the US on his F1 visa in May and I am considering options of joining him earlier than mid-July.

I think about applying for an F2 visa (given that the visa processing and wait times are short in my country) and then going to Mexico and reentering the US as an F1 student around when the semester starts.

1) My husband's school's International office said that holding both F1 and F2 is not a problem but we heard that consular officers may retract my F1 visa. Is this correct? And given my intentions what do you think the result will be? Should I contact the embassy via email beforehand?

&amp;#x200B;

2) If F1 visa gets retracted, will it be at the moment when I am added to my husband's SEVIS record and I receive dependent I-20 (I guess not this one) OR when I apply for an F-2 visa and make an interview arrangement at the embassy OR when I apply, get approved and receive the F-2 visa?

&amp;#x200B;

3) If for some reason, I am refused to get the F-2 visa, will I save my current F-1? 

&amp;#x200B;

4) If say I receive the visa and come to the US as F2 dependent and for some reason I do not continue with my studies and get rid of the F1 visa, will this somehow affect me in the future for visa related matters given that I received the F2 visa to just join my husband earlier and then planned to switch to F1 as the semester starts. This is not what I intend to do and I am going to tell about my real plan behind applying for F2 during the embassy interview and just wanted to see if later things change will that somehow affect me in the future or not.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you."

t3_n4j4zo,10,Questions on I-20 reinstatement and returning to USA,2021-05-04 08:18:20,"Hello all,

Just in need of some help!
So basically during the start of Covid (March 2020) I returned home to Australia and finished the spring semester online. I thought I would never go back to finish my studies so I got a job and requested my dso terminate my I-20 for early withdrawal in that fall. 

Fast forward I now want to return to the USA this coming fall and complete my studies. So my question is will this be possible?

My visa expires in June 2024 and from my understanding I do not need to reapply for a new visa I just need to get a new I-20 and will have to repay the sevis fee as I have been outside the country for more then 5 months.

If this is true will I be treated as an initial student or continuing student? As I read if I’m a continuing student who held valid visa on March 9 2020 I am able to take a full course load online inside the USA.

Sorry for all the questions but all help will be greatly appreciated thanks for taking the time to read

So I just got off-call with my international advisor at my university and I got some peculiar news.

I am an international student on f-1 visa whose gonna graduate this semester. I’m currently taking remote classes from india. My plan was to go back to the US on May 9th but then the india travel ban hit and its highly unlikely I’ll be able to travel now. My I-20 is gonna be shortened to May 15th, 2021 cause I’ll be graduating in like 10 days. I wanted to come back and apply for OPT before May 15th.

Now when I had called the DSO before (like 2 weeks ago), I asked if I could apply for OPT remotely and they said no, I had to be physically present in the US. Now I called them again and asked if there was any way I could apply for an OPT from India and they said yes, I could apply for it from outside the US cause of COVID and some students have done it like this remotely and got their OPT processed. This was a big shock for me and I am having some trouble believing them. Could it be that the DSO was mistaken? I don’t see anything online that says we can apply for OPT when outside the US.

So my question is, can I apply for OPT from outside the US?"

I submitted an e-request to the USCIS to correct this error but they said they would get back to my by May 28th 2021. I would most likely lose all the jobs I interviewed for because they wanted me to start by the end of May or beginning of June. 

Is there anything else I can do about this? I am unable to talk to anyone from the USCIS because the automated bot doesn't let me do so.

Now my question is, is that all that I have to do? Can I just book a flight and enter US say 5 days before my program start date? I.E Is my F1 Visa still 'valid' since the expiry date is June 2023?  
( What I also mean by this is that : What exactly makes a F1 Visa 'VALID' ? Is it purely just the expiration date on my visa sticker? Or there are things  that happen behind the scenes that can also affect it's 'validity' )

OR did my decision to gap year affected my F1 Visa? Will I have to go through all the Visa application process like I did the first time (Interview at the consulate etc?)I am little anxious cause the visa appointment times are messed up in my area.

I am a Masters Student.

So Right now I am in my Semester 4 but not my last semester as i had 3 pre-requisites in my 1st semester.

Currently I am stuck in a very critical situation, which will affect the completion of my course itself. Last year in December 2020, my father was hospitalised and I had to take the immediate decision and risk flying back to India. As my scores were not that great I was not eligible to receive an I20 then. The only option available to me was to complete the next semester online and then come back to the US for the last semester. Analyzing all the risks and anticipating the grades I would score, I flew to India before I could get my results. Even in the worst case scenario I should have received a B/C. Unfortunately in one of the subjects I received a D, which has directly affected my GPA. Post this I requested that particular faculty but he could not do anything further.


So now for this semester even though i score 3 A's my GPA would round up to nly 2.92 and i cannot get an approved i20 to go back to US for my last semester.

As of now i am quite sure that i would get 3 A's but that wont help my case.

I tried contacting my earlier professor for some grade change if possible but i didnt get a positive response.


I want your help and advice as to what my options are right now to get back to the States. Is there anyway if transfer to any other Univ is also possible. Kindly let me know. Please help or any other advice will also be helpful."

I would greatly appreciation contribution from international students who have worked in the USA and returned/thinking about returning to their home country. 

I made a quick research on 401(k) and leaving the US after using my 3 years of OPT (STEM major). From my understanding, there will be a 10% penalty for withdrawing the 401(k) savings. Is this also true for F-1 visa holders on OPT? I've met some people (aged &lt;35) who claimed that there is no penalty for withdrawing the 401(k), and left the USA with the entirety of their 401k (I must admit I'm skeptical if what they say is true). 

Also, I cannot find reliable/consistent sources for dealing with IRA accounts from outside the USA. Once you leave the country with your IRA account still active in the USA, what is the process of withdrawing the money when you turn 59.5? Do you need to be physically present in the USA, as of current rules? Do you need an active USA bank?

However, now with the covid crisis so bad in india, I really don’t want to go back to india only to try to return, in the midst of all this chaos - for health reasons, but also because I’m not confident I’ll get an expedited appointment in time (when I assume everybody will be applying for one around the same time and they will have a backlog). I deferred my admission by a year last year, and I really don’t think I can afford to do so again.


My question is: can I apply for change of status within the US, and then when things are hopefully better by december, leave the country to come back through consular processing. I understand that the change of status petition takes a long time (and it may not be approved in time for next summer when I will need CPT).

I’m currently authorized to work under OPT which should conclude on June 25, 2021. I had applied for the STEM OPT Extension, but I used an outdated Form I-765, and as a result, my application was summarily rejected without consideration. USCIS has asked me to apply again, but because of changes in circumstances, I’m not sure what the correct application format would be. In particular,

1. USCIS has started accepting online applications. USCIS has given me a letter on green paper that I’m supposed to use to preface my application for the same benefit. There’s no place to upload this on the online application however, so I don’t know whether to use the online application or mail the paper application in.
2. I also just realized that I had mailed in the application to the wrong lockbox. The Form I-797C that I received with the rejection asks me to mail it back to the original lockbox I had applied to in Phoenix, AZ. Currently, USCIS is accepting STEM OPT applications out of their Chicago field office, and so it’s unclear to me where I ought to send this to.

All this because I followed the instructions on my university page that wasn't updated when filing my OPT application. I know this is a really tricky situation but I keep getting conflicting advice from everyone and I'm trying to see if anyone is in similar situation. Any help is appreciated!"

Even when there are slots available, it's this same error each time. All I want right now is a slot even in say, September or February 2022 so that I can submit a request for an expedited interview. However, I can't even book this first appointment? 

What am I doing wrong? Is there a specific time when I should book? Please please help :("

t3_nd71dh,3,Regaining F-1 by traveling to US adjacent islands,2021-05-15 19:52:47,"I am finishing my undergraduate program and applied for OPT — my DSO alerted me that I have been out of status since August 2020. I didn’t know this since I was pursuing at 4-year program with an I-20 issued for only 3 years. 

I got accepted into a Masters Program at another institution and I haven’t contacted the school’s international office yet because I’m still trying to sort out my finances. 

Regarding my out of status, my current DSO has suggested either doing reinstatement or traveling to a US adjacent islands with a new I-20. (Not sure if I would get the new I-20 from my current or new program — my current DSO and the new DSO are within the same “university network” so they might be able to communicate)

I’m in contacts with an immigration lawyer to help me with reinstatement but they’re taking their time too. Reinstatement would take a very long time and isn’t guaranteed either so I’m leaning towards the second option of traveling (1. It’s quicker 2. I need to work on campus to get some of my tuition paid for 3. But my visa is currently expired. )

I understand there are risks in both options perhaps even more with reinstatement since it’s more than 5 months since I’ve been out of status but I’d appreciate it if anyone who might have the same experience could share theirs.  

TLDR Does anyone have experience with over-staying past I-20 end date and leaving the US to an adjacent island with an expired visa and entering the US with a new I-20? 

Thank you! I’m sorry for typos or weird formatting"

Anyone else in the same boat? Was my appointment preserved because it was scheduled before the new visa services suspension? Does it have anything to do with NIE?

t3_nfsjag,8,Query about initial OPT/ EAD ( To ease my anxiety ),2021-05-19 01:43:55,"Hello Folks,

Recently USCIS made the application process for filing form I-765 available online. And the process was pretty simple. You answer the question and provide the needed documents. On April 30 I filed the application and got receipt/ notice in the mail that they've received the application. Now, on May 14 I realized a lot of my friends who filed through mail submitted their US visa stamp in the passport and also the initial I-20 that was received during the admit. The reason I didn't submit the two documents was because it was not asked for during the online application process ( They asked for my passport scan copy of first &amp; last page and CPT I-20 and I provided them with the same). Now since the application was online, the USCIS portal is allowing one to upload unsolicited documents to their application and I submitted the two documents that I didn't submit earlier.  

And since then I've been stressed and anxious about some questions I've on my mind. It'd be great if anyone can answer them.

1.) Is it required to send initial I-20 and US visa stamp in passport?
2.) Since I uploaded the above documents late on the portal, would it delay my processing time? 

Any input is highly appreciated! 

Thank you in advance."

Since the application asks us to submit digital photo, I submitted the one with wrong dimensions. Now in online applications one can upload documents even after submitting the applications (including the photo). Now my questions are:

1.) Is it okay to submit it now? I've submitted my application on April 30. 
2.) Will it delay my application processing if I submit the documents now? 

Any input is highly appreciated,

Travel information
1. I have a ticket booked to get to the US but not to leave. Do i just enter an estimated date of departure? Do they want the date I depart the US for good, or just for this trip? I.e., do I enter a date that would be after graduation, or the date fall semester ends because I will definitely be travelling for winter break? 
2. Entity paying for trip: do they just want info about who's paying for flights etc, or all education and living expenses? I will be on a research assistantship that will provide a tuition waiver and stipend. If the assistantship were to go away, i have enough money to cover rent etc but not tuition. 

Work: additional information
3. In how much detail do i need to tell them about professional, social, or charitable orgs? I have listed a mental health non-profit that i volunteer for. Do student orgs from college count? What else might i be missing? 

Location
4. Will I be bound to the location i designate here or will I be able to choose a different embassy or consulate when looking for an appointment? This is in India, if relevant. 

Thanks!"

Current itinerary is:

1. Fly NZ-US, enter on VWP \~60 days before class starts (with a return ticket) to visit friends/spend time with my partner.
2. Refund my return ticket once I've arrived.
3. Fly US-Mexico for a weekend \~25 days before class starts (such that I can re-enter on F1).
4. Fly Mexico-US, enter on F1 visa.

My main questions are:

* Will there be issues flying to/from Mexico? I see from many other posts that technically on the VWP you must not terminate your travel in Canada, Mexico or nearby Islands. **Is this relevant? as I will re-enter on a F1 visa, not via the VWP.**
* I know that travel to Canada/Mexico/nearby Islands count as part of the 90 day ESTA limit, so **will the days keep on accumulating once I re-enter on the F1 and eventually exceed 90? as I never technically left by this definition.**
* Will I be able to re-enter the US after only \~2days in Mexico?

Any advice would be much appreciated, thanks!"

t3_nn5bq5,2,F1 visa opportunity after living in the US for over 8 years.,2021-05-28 19:17:18,"Hi everyone, 

I entered the US when I was 12 with my parents with B2 visa and when we got to the US we changed our status to F1 I was F2 dependent for 4-5 years. Then my parents got E2 status and I was the dependent on that status. I go to Purdue University now and my E2 dependent status expires when I turn 21 in September of 2021. I have filed I-539 from E2 to F1 but it seems like it will not get approved in time before I age out of my E2 dependent status in September. I am planning on going back to Mongolia and try to get my F1 visa this summer.

My question is that how likely am I to get the visa since I have stayed in the US for over 8 years at this point. I have kept lawful status in the US all of those years."

I’ve sent everything through FEdEx on March 21st. 

App. Received on March 26 , got the NOA few days later. 

May 20th : New card processing 
May 21st : Case approved 
May 26th : Card was mailed 
May 28th : I got my card in the mail but did not get any approval notice. 


I do have a few questions : wasn’t the new guideline to allow 14 months or so on the OPT EAD ? I did not get that but I guess that’s fine. 

Im currently on my 3 month unemployment period and would like to know if that takes time off the work authorization period ( I’m assuming yes?) 

Anyways, I majored in Finance with few experiences in finance , ops etc. if anyone has any tips , any leads to find a job that would be very helpful!!

So I currently have an F-1 visa for a Ph.D. program but want to withdraw or take a leave of absence (longer than 5 months) from my studies and join my wife in the US (who has an F-1 visa) with an F-2 visa. I contacted the embassy and they said that I can have either an F-1 or F-2 visa in my passport (holding two visas of the same F class is not allowed) and during the interview for the F-2 visa, my F-1 visa will be canceled.

&amp;#x200B;

I am wondering what you think if there is going to be any issue regarding my change from F-1 to F-2 given that the reason for this change is that I did not find the school program very useful and match align with my future plans and that is the main reason I am changing from F-1 to F-2. Do you think there will be any complications now or in the future?

Because of the pandemic and the uncertain situation with the consulates and traveling back home, I have decided to remain in the US in between the end of my undergrad and grad, and keep my valid status here via SEVIS transfer. The thing is, I want to go back home at the end of the year, as I am hoping that traveling will be ok and the consulate will be open. Everything is contingent on that. The thing is, considering all of that is the case, once I do go back home I am going to have to apply for a new student visa, since the one I currently hold is about to expire.

I have 2 matters that I am concerned about could affect my being granted a new visa, and I wanted to see whether someone here can enlighten me on this, because if these could definitely pose a threat to me getting a new visa, I won't go back home at all, as I will have already started my graduate program and would be devastated if I got denied and couldn't finish my masters.

My start date per my EAD is July 1, 2020 but, I wasn't able to find a job till September 22, 2020. This was 84 days after the start date (Still under the 90 day limit). As soon as I start working, I report my employment to my DSO. In the month of December, my employer started talking about laying people off due to COVID and since I was new, I could be one of them. So I start looking for another job. As expected, on January 6th, I got a letter from my 1st employer saying I was fired. During my job search, I was able to get another offer which allowed me to start the next day after I was laid off i.e. January 7th. This was good since it wouldn't have added any more unemployment days to my pre-existing 84 days. I report this 2nd job to my DSO and come to find out that she never reported the 1st job to the SEVIS portal and now it was inactive. Due to this, I couldn't start working till the SEVIS was active, which took several days for them to reactivate it. During this time I exceeded my Unemployment days 90 day clock. Now, when I reached out to my DSO for an I20 to apply for the STEM extension, she says my OPT is not active anymore due to the 90 day limit exceeded. She suggested filing form I290B to appeal this action but this was rejected by USCIS twice. I submitted all the required evidence (emails from DSO, job offers, etc.) with a statement explaining my situation.

What is the best course of action here? Should I have not filed an Appeal and Filed a motion instead?

Can I still file a motion to reconsider or reopen? Any help is appreciated.

TL, DR

1. Started 1st job on 84th day after EAD start date.
2. DSO didn't report to SEVIS.
3. Got laid off and had a 2nd job lined up for next day.
4. Couldn't start due to inactive SEVIS and had to wait for DSO to fix that and exceeded 90 days.
5. OPT inactive and can't get STEM extension I20"

t3_nqvrem,16,Concerns requesting EAD correction to receive full year of OPT authorization,2021-06-02 20:40:08,"Hi everyone. Do any of you (students or DSOs) have any experience with the process of obtaining an EAD correction in order to receive the full year of OPT, if less than the full year was originally granted?

On February 26th, USCIS announced covid-related flexibilities, and they implemented a change in protocol so that all OPT applications approved will now receive the full amount of OPT time that was recommended by their DSO. In other words, the expiration date of the one-year EAD (for those who received a recommendation for a full 12 months) is no longer capped at 14 months after the graduation date, but rather 14 months after the EAD approval date.

The announcement contains the following:

&gt;""Beginning today, USCIS will approve applications for post-completion OPT with validity dates reflecting the same amount of time originally recommended by the designated school official (DSO) from their school on the Form I-20, Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status.

&gt;F-1 students requesting post-completion OPT who receive an approval of Form I-765 for less than the full amount of OPT time requested (not to exceed 12 months) due to the requirement that the OPT be completed within 14 months of the program end date may [request a correction](https://www.uscis.gov/green-card/green-card-processes-and-procedures/employment-authorization-document) of the EAD due to USCIS error. USCIS will issue a corrected EAD with a new end date, as requested, to cover the full amount of OPT time recommended in the original application.""

In my case, my program end date was May 2nd (2020); I received an EAD that is valid from 8/20/20 to 07/02/21. I would like to request a correction so that my initial EAD expires on 08/20/21, to recover those 1.5 months of lost authorization, but I'm very concerned about the amount of time I have left on my EAD and any STEM-OPT-related risks of requesting a correction.

I submitted a USCIS Service Request for a correction, but I was quoted a response time by **June 22nd!** I am concerned that if at that time I'm told to mail out my EAD and then wait several weeks for a correction to go live, I'll miss out on my window to apply for STEM OPT altogether. I'm also concerned that if I request a STEM OPT recommendation right now, I will lose my window to correct my initial EAD, and completely miss out on 1.5 months of employment authorization that USCIS is now willing to grant.

The generic EAD correction instructions state the following, and the section about ""no longer having any basis for applying for an EAD"" is extremely concerning, especially in the event that my correction request is not approved before my original expiration date of July 2nd:

&gt;If your EAD contains incorrect information **because of a USCIS error**, we will make the appropriate correction at no additional cost to you. In these cases, you do not need to submit a new Form I-765 or a filing fee. Instead, you must submit:  
&gt;  
&gt;The original card containing the error,  
&gt;  
&gt;A detailed explanation of the card error, and  
&gt;  
&gt;Supporting documentation on the correct information.   
&gt;  
&gt;Submit this information to the [service center](https://egov.uscis.gov/office-locator/#/serv) or [National Benefit Center](https://egov.uscis.gov/office-locator/#/nbc) that approved your latest Form I-765.  
&gt;  
&gt;In either case, if we receive your application or request for a replacement EAD and you no longer have any basis for applying for an EAD or employment authorization, we will not return the card and will notify you that you do not have a current basis for applying for an EAD or employment authorization.

How would you advise me to proceed?"

I am a third-year undergrad student who has been studying in the US under F-1 visa for almost 10 years now. My visa will expire next month. I am also planning to go to graduate schools in the U.S. I'm screwed if I do go back this summer and can't renew my visa, since I still have one more year at my undergrad university.

Here are my background info:

\- maintained a lawful status, no working outside of school. Worked for a few years in school--properly filed tax returns for those years as well. However, I haven't turned in my form 8843 for the years I have not been working. I am planning to turn them in ASAP.

\- strong ties to my home country, since all my family members reside there (no relatives or anything in the US).

\- Very high GPA (3.9+)

\- I have ""good"" travel records (visited my home country 2\~3 times a year)

\- attending a liberal arts college

Would I have a ground for rejection just because I have been staying in the US for too long?

Thanks for the response!"

However, I just got off the phone with a recruiter for one company and he says H-1B is required for non-university hires, so if I don't have H-1B I probably can't work there. Do most companies have this policy? Has anyone transferred while on STEM? This was a FinTech company."

Could you possible tell me about your experience, how did the application go, was it approved, were there any consequences?

I am a phd student on my 11th year of an F1 visa. I have been in valid status the whole time: 4 years undergrad -&gt; opt - &gt; masters -&gt; opt -&gt; phd year one now. Both masters and undergrad were at the same school. Phd now is at a new school. 

I have not been to my home country since my undergrad opt, so about 5 years ago. My visa expired then as well, but my i-20s have always been valid. My home country's relations with the US aren't the best and there is a chance that if I go home, I will not be able to get a visa to enter the country, just because of the current political situation.

Would you recommend trying my luck applying for the financial hardship work authorization, or is there a significant risk of losing the current f-1 status? 

My parents are sponsoring my studies, but I am at risk of losing my scholarship and the home country currency has not been very stable in relation to the USD. I could really use some funds to cover my housing and possibly an almost double increase in tuition if i lose my scholarship. I have an on campus job, but have not been getting the promised 20hrs due to covid, i only averaged to about 3-4hrs a week, my supervisor would be willing to confirm with a letter.

I have 2 more years left on my phd and hoping for another opt after.  Would applying jeopardize my current i-20 that was issued for 3 years? Would it affect my chances of opt approval in 2 years? Could the school recall my current i-20 due to lack of funds? (even though i have shown my parents bank statements with more than sufficient funds during the initial application).

Any advice would be appreciated."

I graduated in 2018 from one of the top 10 engineering colleges in India. I am going to pursue my masters in the field of ECE (specialization: nanoscale devices and systems) from UC San Diego. To sponsor my education, I have taken out a loan of 45 lakhs, and including my personal savings, I will have up to 60 lakhs of liquid funds of my own. My parents are not wealthy and do not earn a lot. They can sustain themselves very well but don't have huge savings. They have a stable house that they live in currently and I want to have one of first cousins or my uncle sponsor me for additional funds needed. Some things to note:

1. My I-20 amount is 40 lakhs
2. I had an education loan for bachelor's (10 lakhs) that I paid off in 2 years time
3. My uncle has a good amount in fixed assets, but around \~ 10 lakhs of liquid assets
4. I have 3 years of work experience in the same company that is dominant in electronics market
5. I have a very good reason to pursue my masters since it is directly related to my career path and I need to study abroad since this field has little to no education scope in India and UCSD happens to be a leader in this sphere.
6. I am the only son, so I have a good reason to return back to India after my education.
7. My GRE: 325, TOEFL: 113, 10th standard: 90%+(ICSE board), 12th standard: 95%(CBSE board), Bachelor's: 8+ CGPA.

My question is this:

1. Will my father's poor financial status affect my application in any way? If that is so, how to avoid that?
2. Is is okay to have more than one sponsor of my education in the immediate family who are all well earning?
3. I have been sponsoring my own education since 11th standard (loans and scholarships) should I mention it in the interview? Will it say I am responsible and reliable?
4. Is it okay if I say I want to work for a couple of years in the US to learn the specialty that my stream of choice demands?
5. Should I say that I will use the money from CPT/OPT to fund my last semester?
6. Can I say that I have 3+ years of work ex in very relevant field and it will help me get jobs easily?
7. To pay back my education loan for masters, is it okay to say that I will be the only one paying back the loan since none of my family members are financially strong enough to pay it back. How can I save myself from this question?

Please let me know if you can help resolve some of my doubts before my visa interview. If there are any specific red flags that I need to address before the interview, please highlight them.

t3_nvcvzj,14,Do employers need to file anything to the government for hiring someone on OPT?,2021-06-08 19:59:23,"My EAD start date was yesterday as I was told by the company that I will be starting this Monday. I’ve been logging into work with nothing to do for the past two days, and was finally provided an update from HR saying their immigration lawyer is still working on submitting my documents, and told me my start date has been pushed back to next Monday.

I am confused because I thought employers aren’t required to do any reporting regarding OPT.

I have low hopes of getting picked during the H1B lottery next year, since I do not qualify for STEM OPT, and was planning on applying for PR in Canada. One of the requirements is to have one year continuous experience, and now that my start date has been pushed back a week, I will be 1 week short to meet that requirement. That’s why this is such a big deal for me.


Just wanted to ask and see if anyone knows if employers are required to submit anything to USCIS regarding a hire on OPT?"
t3_nvj105,9,Can you contribute to open source programming projects on an F1 visa? What about volunteering for a professor as a research assistant?,2021-06-09 00:35:49,"Hi all,

I've read a lot about volunteering vs unpaid internship, what is/isn't allowed on an F1 visa, and I'm a bit confused. It seems like: volunteering for a genuine charitable non-profit is OK, and unpaid internships are only OK if they meet strict labor criteria and this is rare (must be for benefit of student, similar to educational training, not much benefit to employer, etc).

So the two cases I listed in my topic title are examples of what confuses me:

* Contributing to open source programming projects: is this OK to do on an F1 visa? What would it fall under? Assuming of course that there is no compensation of any kind. Is it basically the same as working on a side project, but with a group of people - ie not volunteering, not an internship, not employment of any kind?
* Volunteering to help a professor with their research: I see this suggested a lot, even as a way to 'stop the OPT unemployment clock'. But I assume it's not 'volunteering' - is it a type of allowed 'unpaid internship'? Do you need OPT to do this?
* Bonus question: working on a side project, by myself or with other people, and eg publishing it on the app store/on a website, again assuming no compensation of any form (no donations, etc). Is this OK?

&amp;#x200B;

These are all cases that I imagine every F1 student in computer science does, or is open to, but I'm just confused about what criteria they fall under. Thanks!"
t3_nvskvl,2,Expedited Appointment attached documents,2021-06-09 10:31:29,"So my classes begin on 23 August and earliest admission date is 12 July.

1. I-20
2. a screenshot of the cgi no appointment available. 
3. my SEVIS confirmation payment. 

I didn't include my admission letter (which includes the info that I won two fellowships). Will this cause a problem?

t3_nwb6ag,3,[Urgent] Signing Offer Letter While Waiting For STEM OPT Application,2021-06-10 01:01:01,"Hi,     


Asking for a friend. He has applied for the STEM OPT and application is currently with USCIS. However, he was recruiting with another company and they just gave him an offer.  They have agreed to give a tentative start date that can be pushed depending on when he gets the new EAD. 

&amp;#x200B;

Can he sign an offer letter for the time being? Does signing the offer letter affect his immigration status?

Which appointment letter should I send? Likewise, should I request a new I20 with travel signature with my current employer or my future one?
- Where am I supposed to send the necessary documents? I know I need a passport, valid Visa, letter of appointment, i20 with travel signature but where is this stuff supposed to go? No website seems to say that and my university hasn't replied to my question about this.
- Am I supposed to send my actual passport and EAD or just copies of the EAD card, passport bio, and Visa pages?

My OPT Extension is ending july of next year but I’m trying to switch to a TN visa because I want to travel to Europe sometime later this year which is not possible at the moment since my F-1 visa is expired and thus I can’t go to any country other than Mexico and Canada. I’d like to avoid doing the change of status by mail and am willing to go to a consulate in mexico to do this (It would partly also be a small vacation since I love my country lol) However I have some questions about the specifics of this process such as is if it’s possible to switch to the TN visa while still working under the STEM OPT? Legally does my company have to “fire” me and “rehire” at some point during this process? up to what point would it be illegal for me to work for this company while doing the visa process? (I’m trying to go to mexico during a week where I’m supposed to work from home but I’m not sure if legally it’d be better to take PTO to do so) Do I have to wait until my STEM OPT Expires?

I am on F1, on non-resident status, getting paid as an assistant (20hours per week) on campus even when I'm away from the US. 
I plan to work while I'm in my home country for vacation. As a freelancer I will get paid through PayPal. I heard that US work rules do not apply to work restrictions when we're out of the States. 

My worries are:

1- Could being registered and paid as a worker in the US and working in my home country at the same time be illegal?
2- PayPal is not used in my home country so I registered to the system using my US address and phone number and I will eventually connect it to my US bank account... However, now I'm thinking about what will happen if PayPal sends me a form 1099 or a similar form reporting this income for tax purposes... This income will be earned while I am outside of the US, so I think I can just ignore this form when reporting my taxes. But then I am afraid of what happens if PayPal treats it as US income and reports it to IRS as well? Could I maybe use my I-94 travel dates and paypal payment dates as proof of that I earned this money outside of the US?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a student on an F-1 Visa. A while ago, I applied for asylum and got my EAD (work authorization) through the asylum application. While it is considered as ""lawful employment,"" I'm worried that using my EAD may put my F-1 in danger. Has any of you been in my situation?

t3_o02knp,6,Funds for f1 visa,2021-06-15 01:41:21,"Hi all
My I-20 has 50k USD amount as my first year (8 months) expenses for fees and living. Amount I am able to show in my account is worth 60k (15k in scholarship and remaining 45K in savings). Is this enough for the visa interview?

I see many recommends 150% of I-20 amount in savings which will be around 75k. Where as I only have 60k USD. I may have some stocks and my father would be willing to support me by showing our home as immovable asset which will be worth 80-90K USD. 

What can I answer VO when he asks about finances? Will having less savings impact my chances of getting visa? Can I say I have applied for loan? I am not be able to secure before the interview because it is taking longer time to sanction a loan due to covid. 

TIA"

My uni stopped issuing OPTs earlier this year, which is why most of the international students at school were left scrambling. By March 31, they suddenly decided to start issuing them again, right before spring break. We weren’t allowed to do anything till we returned to school and met with the DSO so I was only able to start the OPT process around April 7. Our DSO was being real uptight and didn’t let us submit our applications until she spoke to all of us. I had my entire packet ready by the 9th and sent it through my school’s mail room as advised by my DSO. Little did I know she picked the SLOWEST possible shipping method, leading to a 2 week long delay. USCIS finally received my application on the 21st (April), and I got my receipt notice two weeks later. I’m extremely frustrated with my institution and how they’re handling their international students so I’m trying to gain insight from other avenues.

Since January I’ve been applying to jobs and received a few offers but because I haven’t received my EAD yet, it became an issue for some employers. I’ve been waiting on this particular job for a month, busted my ass studying and practicing for my technical and in-person interviews. I was finally extended a verbal offer two days ago and I was asked if I could start by the 12th of July. I told her that my start date is still ambiguous due to all the delays, but am hopeful that I’ll have my EAD by late July. She said the company wasn’t in a rush, but wasn’t really clear on whether or not they’ll be willing to wait for very long. It’s been 57 days since my application was last updated, and I really don’t want this job to slip away. I’ve checked opttimeline.com, and while applications within my receipt date are moving, there are still nearly a thousand applications pending for my case range.

I am an international student on an F1 visa who just graduated last May. My OPT start date was just a few days ago (June 15). I don't have a job yet. My problem is that one of my family members who is in my home country, Nepal, is really sick with Covid and I need to be there for him. So, I need to go back home as fast as possible. The only problem is that since I am on my OPT and I don't have a job, it seems like I won't be able to return to the US.

I can only think of one way being able to return to the US. I was thinking of contacting one of those shady IT consultancy companies that target and exploit H1Bs and OPT students (I'm a comp sci student), and asking them for an offer letter, which it seems they might provide quickly. I'm not sure how feasible this is, or if it is a good idea. Also, if anybody has worked for these consultancies, please let me know of your experience.

Another thing I though of is going to my home country and applying to US jobs from there (hoping interviews are all remote). I think this idea is less feasible though.

As you can see, my EAD is only valid for 9 months, when it should be 12 months.The international student center at my university determined that this is a USCIS typo, since I have never applied for pre-completion OPT and the I20 lists the dates as 06/30/21 to 06/29/22.

New incoming F1 student here and I'm looking at some housing options. I'm keen on subletting a room for myself, and I wanted to ask if this is allowed to do on a F1 visa? Or does your accommodation have to be more 'official'? If I sublet, should I make sure that I have a signed paper contract with my name on it - ie I officially 'take over' the lease - or does it not matter so much?

Also, I read that it's useful to have proof of accommodation when entering over the border. How official does this have to be - would an email/print-out of chat conversation where the lease is agreed suffice?

And finally - would a sublet address be fine to report as my local US address on the SEVIS portal?

Our only options are that she comes with me using her tourist visa and apply for a change of status.

Due to COVID-19, I've had to postpone the start of my master's degree by one year. After a year of waiting I was excited to finally start this summer, but lo and behold... the next available visa interview date is in 2022! (The Netherlands). The consulate general doesn't allow F1 applicants to ask for an expedited appointment (or, more accurately, they'll turn down any such requests), even though my university (Columbia U) clearly stated that all embassies and consulates received orders to accommodate students as best as they could.

The university doesn't allow me to defer by another semester, so I'm afraid I'll have to cancel my study altogether after a whole year of waiting.

I've tried to arrange a visa interview in Germany or Belgium, but the only consulate that accepts foreigners (Frankfurt) has no F1 interview slots. On top of that, foreigners are not allowed to request to expedite their appointment in Frankfurt. It seems to me that I am terribly stuck.

As an act of desperation I'm turning to Reddit to ask you this: What would you recommend? Should I simply wait and hope that the situation will change for the better? Should I still attempt to get a visa interview arranged in a different country? I would love to hear some thoughts.

Thank you all for taking your time to read this.

EDIT/UPDATE: I managed to get an appointment (this month even!). The consulate general in Amsterdam seems to open up new dates/times from time to time. I would personally recommend those who did not get an appointment yet to NOT plan an appointment elsewhere and simply wait for new dates/times to open up in Amsterdam."

I had to return to India due to a medical emergency concerning my parent and was only recently able to get an appointment. The program start date on my valid I-20 is 2015 and my OPT start date is Nov, 2020.  Since I have an active SEVIS ID, I believe I am still a continuing student.   
My DSO told me that  OPT holders can travel after July 30.  
Question: Since my start date is much before Aug 1, 2021, what is the likelihood of receiving a visa extension? I have all the required documents as stated by the consulate as well as proof of employment.  
Would it be beneficial to reschedule my appointment to a later date, say around August, to prove that I don't intend to travel right now?  
Should I reach out to my DSO and ask them to draft a letter stating that my program start date cannot be changed since I'm on OPT, or does that not matter?"
t3_o8yk41,28,CEAC - Visa status changed from Refused to Administrative Processing to Refused again!,2021-06-27 14:51:57,"Hi,   


This is Rafi from Bangladesh. I attended my F1 visa interview on 25th May. The visa officer initially approved my visa. I was so happy. But on the same day after about an hour, I received a ""**nonimmigrant visa questionnaire**"" via email. Which asks for things like travel history, job history, places that I lived, etc., and my CEAC status was ""**Refused**"".  


I emailed them back with the answers on 27th May and waited about a month for an update. Finally, on 23rd June CEAC status was changed to ""**Administrative Processing**"". But sadly on 24th June CEAC status changed back to ""**Refused**"" again.

  
I know many students who received questionnaires like me and their status was ""Refused"". But once it was updated to ""**Administrative Processing**"". They got their visa ""**Issued**"" within a few days or weeks.   


AFAIK, it's me only whose case changed from **Refused** \&gt; **AP** \&gt; **Refused**, again.

  
I have to be on campus by 15th August. This processing is so frustrating that it is driving me nuts.   


Could you please tell me, what should I do? Do you know someone with a similar scenario? How long they will take to resolve my case?  


Regards"

I used to live in the town where my university campus is located (like any international student 🤷‍♂️). However, I got married to a US citizen, and we life together now (I'm still a student). However, we moved to a town that is 1.5 hours away from my university campus (same state) since my spouse works full time there. I drive 1.5 hours to school every day. I haven't told my DSO about my marriage (since I've never liked them) nor my new real address. On the Integrated Student Information System, I still have the old address from when I lived with roommates in-town (they still live there, so they always keep any university correspondence/document I get in the mail for me). Nothing has changed academically, I just know live in another town. I got to class, get good grades, and do research. **Will I get in trouble if I do not let my DSO know about my true address?** I am graduate student, my research advisor (boss) knows everything. I just don't want to let my DSO know since I don't trust them, and I don't want them to interfere with my green card process.

t3_obz53e,6,Is this discrimination?,2021-07-02 00:38:53,"I recently interviewed for an internship position as an F-1 student. The internship is only 10 weeks long, part time during the school year so I was planning on applying for CPT after I got the acceptance letter. The recruiter said I was qualified but could not consider me due to my visa status, even though they do not have to sponsor me. While I indicated that my I-20 is valid until May 2022, they said that that is the company’s policy. She said the reason being:
1. They are afraid to spend money on sponsoring me after I graduate….This makes no sense the internship is only 10 months, and although the internship can increase my chance of getting a job with a company, this is not guaranteed and I would still need apply to jobs again separately once I graduate. I had no intention of doing anything more than the internship and do not understand their reasoning on disqualifying me based on a future h1b application
2. Because their 3rd party recruiting agents don’t work with international applicants.

I would understand why some company do not want to spend money on sponsoring students after work. However, this is a 2.5 months internship that requires no additional work on their part as long as I apply for CPT. I am just feeling very frustrated overall."

At the beginning of this month I was looking at my information on the SEVIS portal and realized that the end date I put down for my previous employer (which I left within my initial post grad opt and before my expiration date) did not update and I kept getting JSON errors (maybe due to poor JSON formatting on their part). I contacted my DSO and they updated it for me but they also issued a new i-20 with the updated end date in the middle of this month and they said I should keep it for my records. It does not look the same as the endorsed i-20 (which says requested for stem opt while the new one says pending).

I was wondering if I would need to submit this i-20 as unsolicited evidence on the USCIS website since my DSO said these questions are reserved for USCIS and not them so I was unsure. (which I think is dumb but they're probably doing it to cover their behinds)

t3_odtsv1,0,Should I upload my new I-20 to my USCIS application?,2021-07-04 21:47:49,"I submitted my STEM OPT application online recently.
I was looking at my information on the SEVIS portal the other day and realized that the end date I put down for my previous employer during my initial opt did not update and I kept getting JSON errors. I contacted my DSO and they updated it for me but they also issued a new i-20 with the updated end date in the middle of last month and they said I should keep it for my records. It does not look the same as the endorsed i-20 that I submitted in my application.

I was wondering if I would need to submit this i-20 as well as unsolicited evidence on the USCIS website since it was unclear what I should do.

If anyone has any advice on this, please do share (sorry if this is a repost. I am just very concerned).
Thank you!"

t3_oe0cda,4,M1 and F1 Visa classes.,2021-07-05 05:12:20,"Hello everyone. I've run into a complicated issue. Currently I'm on a M1 Visa for a trade skill. And, I was planning to ""switch"" the program. I know you cannot change visa from M1 to F1. So I'm planning to apply for a new F1 visa. The prgram that I'm switching to it's all the classes I've took on my M1 cisa plus with some other detailed ones. So they're really similar. 

The problem is that I finish my first year at the end of Fall Semester 2021. While the other's program start date is Fall semester. My pathway navigator adviced me to just take the ""others"" program classes on fall because they're all required to proceed to next semester (so i cannot jump between classes they're all in sequence). While, my international coordinator is saying I need specifically to take classes for my current program or I'll be in violation of my visa status. I can add other clases as long as I take my current program classes and it's over 12 credits.

My question is that is there a guideline or rules on what classes can someone take on M1 visa?"
t3_oe73bi,8,HELP: I made a Grave Mistake,2021-07-05 13:11:30,"I initially applied for an emergency appointment for my F1 visa and it was approved and I got the date August 5, 2021. This morning, I woke up and checked the interview date site, and I made the mistake of rescheduling the appointment date because I thought the date, I saw on the calendar was earlier this month. Unfortunately, the date I selected was July 14, and didn’t realize it was July 14 2022, thereby losing my August 5, 2021 date.
 
To rectify my mistake, I created a new DS-160 form in order to submit a new emergency interview request. In the process of submitting the new emergency interview request, I made another mistake. The mistake I made was not selecting the correct reason for the emergency appointment application; I chose Student Visa as the category initially, but the page refreshed and defaulted to the ESTA denial reason. I submitted the emergency form before I realized the error I had made. 
 
Right now, I am just waiting for a response from the embassy. I have sent them a follow-up email explaining my mistake and asking for help to rectify the issue. Is there anything I can do?"
t3_oeagkd,7,Leave of absence &gt; 8 months and OPT,2021-07-05 16:06:29,"I am a **Master student** majoring in Computer Science and I took a leave of absence for **spring 2021**. I am not taking any classes this summer and I have **2 semester left** before to graduate.

Therefore, I should be back on Fall 2021 to finish my degree and since I have 2 semester left and a Leave Of Absence &lt; 8 months, and from my advisor, everything should be fine for the OPT.

Would it be possible for me to take at least an **extra semester of Leave of Absence** without losing my OPT? In that case I would still have 2 semester left before to graduate but the total amount of leave would be &gt; 8 months. My reason is mostly personal issue related to cov19"
t3_oeblqs,11,"Finished my undergrad with F1 in May 2021, starting a PhD next month in the same major but in a different university. Am I eligible for visa interview waiver?",2021-07-05 17:05:16,"I qualify for all the eligibility questions, except I am a little confused about one. The website says:
""For F, M, or J visa holders and their derivatives:
Must meet all other general criteria as listed above;
I am a regular student and did not drop out of status for 5 months or more (principal F and M);
I am continuing my participation in the same program at a different institution (F, M, and their derivatives);
I am attending the same institution in a different program (F, M, and their derivatives);
My SEVIS number has not changed from the previously issued visa (J and their derivatives).""

Now does starting a PhD with same major count as same program or different program? The major listed in the I-20 from my new institute is the same as the major listed in the old institute (Mechanical Engineering 14.1901), only the Education Level in the new I-20 is Doctorate and in the old I-20 it is Bachelor's. My current visa expires in 2022. My SEVIS Number is the same. My F1 status expires in 2026. 

And in case i am eligible for interview waiver, is it wise to drop off my passport at the consulate when my flight is just a month away? Or to rephrase, is there a chance it will take longer than a month to get my passport with the new visa back?"

I think there is a mistake on my I-94 and travel history record. The I-94 only shows the entry record and doesn't show the departure record (and my ""travel history"" record is not showing anything at all). I only traveled to US about 2 years ago on a B2 visa and had left right after the visit. 

**How do I fix the I-94 and travel history record?** I have looked at the CBP website [https://www.cbp.gov/contact/ports/deferred-inspection-sites](https://www.cbp.gov/contact/ports/deferred-inspection-sites) and call the agent. The agent had given me an email address to asked me to send a request to fix it. I had already sent the email last week. The agent had also told me that they don't respond to email, so I will not know whether they had successfully fixed it. 

Therefore, is there another to communicate and fix the I-94 and travel history record? Or maybe sending the email will not work and I should do something else?

If anyone can shed some light on it, it will be extremely helpful.

I'm  an international student currently pursuing a PhD in physics (on F1 visa) and looking to work in the software industry after graduation.  From what I understand, the F1 OPT (and H1B) requires the job to be  ""related to your degree,"" so it seems like this path is not feasible.  

Despite this, I see international students with physics degrees (or math, stats degrees) working as software engineers post-graduation all the time on LinkedIn and elsewhere online. Some even do software engineer internships in the middle of their studies, which I assume must be done through pre-completion F1 OPT. So I know  this is definitely possible despite the ""rules."" I've reached out to  some of them to ask how they did it but have not gotten a reply yet.  Does anyone here know more details about this kind of transition?

Thanks in advance!"
t3_ofhh0b,9,OPT Withdraw or continue on approved OPT,2021-07-07 12:01:13,"Hey Everyone,

I have a slightly complicated situation so sorry for the long post. I'm a Masters's student in the USA on an F1 visa. I have taken the Thesis option and I was supposed to graduate in May 2021.  I realized my thesis won't be over by then, so extended i20 and carried on over the summer. Now I was positive I would graduate in the summer so I applied for Post Completion OPT online on June 14 (Receipt Date).  My OPT start date is October 4th. Now after discussing with my Thesis committee I know, I will not be able to graduate. I'm now considering converting to non-thesis and graduating ASAP.  I however have 2 routes that I can take and these are tripping me up.  My questions are as follows :

1. **Apply for an OPT withdrawal**: The concerning thing on this route is that my i20 expires on August 13th. Now my DSO says I cannot extend my i20 since my OPT application is active in SEVP. If I apply for a withdrawal, and the request is processed before August 13th, I should be able to apply for an extended i20. However, if the withdrawal is processed after August 13th, I risk going out of status since my i20 won't be extended and I will not be having OPT as it is withdrawn. Is it advisable to apply for a withdrawal since it's already July 7th today?
2. **Let OPT get approved**: If I go on this route, my DSO says I can complete next semester on OPT  without any need for an i20 extension. However, I have few things which are tripping me up. If my OPT is not approved by August 13 and I start classes, which status will I be on? Also If I work part-time from October 4th (OPT start date) to save up on my unemployment days, will this be legal since my OPT is post-completion? Also if I do this will it affect my STEM extension OPT or H1B application in any way?
3. Are there any other ways that I might be missing apart from these?

*OPT Type: Post Completion*

*i20 expiration date: 13th August*

*OPT Received Date: 14th June*

*Current OPT application Status : Pending*"

F-1 visa student here, about to start working on OPT. No STEM extension in my case, so it's gonna be just 12 months. My work is fully remote, so I am pondering the following questions:

1) Can I work from another country, let's say Mexico, during the 12 months of my OPT? If so, do I have to cross the US border every now and then to maintain my F-1 status?

2) Can I continue to work remotely on the same contract from another country once my OPT expires? 

The answer to 2) is conditional on 1). My understanding is that OPT only prevents non-citizens from working on US soil, so if 1) is true then so should 2), but I'd love to verify that with you guys! I'll greatly appreciate your help."
t3_oikkfs,9,Is getting the Visa easier for some countries?,2021-07-12 05:08:29,"Hi, I'm planning on applying for a community college next year. I've heard from many sources that coming from  underrepresented countries make it easier to obtain a visa for the US, but I wasn't sure if this is true or not. I don't want to let my guard down thinking that I'll automatically pass. I'm from Japan(Japanese national but half korean and born in seoul, if thats important) and I took a gap year after high school because i wanted to apply for a japanese school but ended up choosing to go to the US after weighing my options. Anyways, I heard that Japan is one of the underrepresented countries as people here don't go abroad much, so will that make the interview easier at all for me? I'm thinking of telling the officer that I want to come back to Japan as my family and my family house is here and my dream is to advance the tech industry in Japan after i get a 4 year degree from America. I don't know if that'll suffice so I'd appreciate some help to make my application better!(My family can sponsor my expenses)"
t3_oikmq6,2,EAD/f1visa,2021-07-12 05:12:52,"Unique F-1 renewal situation(travel)

So I’ve been working in the US for a year, and have recently sent in an application for STEM-OPT(pending but received the receipt notice) so even though my EAD card is “expired” I have 180 days renewal period/authorization to work. 

I’m planning on flying out to Korea to visit my parents finally with the pandemic slowing down on the 16th of July. My 5 year F-1 visa has expired so my intention was to renew my F-1 visa while there for two weeks. But I’m reading and getting mixed review. With my EAD “expired”, my STEM OPT pending, F-1 visa expired - do any of you have experience applying for a F-1 visa renewal with the premise that my work authorization was extended for 180 days??? I’m ready nervous about not being able to come back to the US.

t3_oilmld,24,Initial OPT online application,2021-07-12 06:27:39,"Hey guys,  I have a situation that’s kind of worrying me and I would like to know your opinion. I applied for initial OPT online on June 4th. My I-20 (before opt recommendation) had August 31st as program end date. When my DSO issued my I-20 with the OPT recommendation, he shortened my program end date to June 30, when asked him why, he said because my on campus employment (graduate assistantship) will end by that date. So I submitted that I -20 with my opt application and specified August 15th to be my OPT start date. A few days after submitting my application, I received on campus employment (teaching assistantship) for the period from June 30th to August 14th, so my DSO issued me a new I-20 with an extended program end date (August 14 instead of June 30). This newer I-20 is also different in that it says OPT “pending”, instead of (requested” . My DSO said that it’s not necessary for me to submit this new I-20 is the 90, 60, and 30 days rules still applies and that it may confuse USCIS which may lead to delays. But I am still a bit worried.  Have you or anyone you know encountered a similar situation? Otherwise your opinion is appreciated. Thank you!"

t3_oiwupb,11,F-1 visa renewal for PhD with a prior history of 221(g),2021-07-12 18:08:32,"I am an Indian citizen pursuing my PhD (in CS) in the US at Georgia Tech. When I first applied for my F-1 visa, I received the 221(g) form. I had to submit additional documentation that included my CV, list of publications and details regarding my prior as well as anticipated research in the US (among other things). My visa was approved about a month after my interview date and it had the “Clearance Received“  annotation. 

My F-1 recently expired on 5th July 2021. I am planning to get it renewed when I visit India in the next couple of months or so (from the Delhi consulate). Note that I am continuing in the same PhD program, there has been no change in my institution and I have maintained my F-1 status (good academic standing) throughout my tenure as an F-1 student for the last 4 years. Additionally, I think I am making good/expected progress towards my degree with an anticipated graduation in Spring 2022 (as stipulated in my current I-20 as well). I had some questions about the renewal process in my case:

(1) Does a prior 221(g) mean that I have to answer the DS-160 question on “Have you ever been refused a US visa” with “Yes”?

(2) How likely is the case that I receive another 221(g) during my renewal as well?

(3) If I preemptively carry documentation similar to what I had to submit in response to the 221(g) last time (detailing my research portfolio, etc), will that help my case for the renewal this time?

(4) Are there any specific questions I should expect and be ready to answer for my interview this time?

(5) For folks in similar situation right now getting 221(g)’s — how long does the wait time look like? Coupled with the airline uncertainties due to the pandemic, I am a little worried about being stuck in India for a long period of time.

(6) Are there any quarantine restrictions for entering the consulate for my interview? Information about this would help me appropriately space out the dates of my flight to India and the visa interview date.

Any answers to the above would be super helpful! Thanks!"

I got my I-20 recently and it has no earliest admission date, and in the remarks it says “continuing student - transfer.” It is an initial I-20. I was a little confused. I  had emailed my school’s visa support and asked when the earliest date I could enter was throughout my datafix process, and I got three different answers:

1. If I didn’t choose to go through with my datafix, I wouldn’t be able to enter the country before July 21

2. As soon as I got my document, I’d be able to use it to enter

3. I couldn’t enter before July 29.

So… I’m really confused. Has anyone been in a similar situation or can offer guidance? I’ve already sent another email.

If you had applied on the US j1 or f1 visas in 2021 and passed the administrative processing, choose below the time range it required.

2) Would I need to leave the airport in Doha because of large layover time? And do I need any transit visa if I don't plan to go outside"

I assume the one year was because of the immigration fiasco last year. Anyhow, I recently found out from my PI that I will have to travel to Belize for my research around April 2021, which is after my visa expires. I assume that I would have to renew my visa before i travel out of the US to make sure I could enter back. This bring me to the questions regarding visa renewal:

1) I’m not sure if USCIS has come up any update regarding F-1 visa renewal that could allow me to renew it within the US?

2) Since my country’s embassy is currently in a mess, I’m thinking about making a trip to Canada ( only a few hours drive) to renew my visa at the US consulate there. Has anyone done this recently? How long does it take? Are the US consulate there open for non-Canadians right now? 

In other note, I’ve never done any visa processing outside of my home country, where would they send my passport with visa to? Would I picking up the passport directly  at the consulate?"

Before being issued my F1 visa, I already had a B1 visitor visa. Since I lost my F1 status after withdrawing, would my B1 visitor visa be void as well? Would there be a way to check on my B1 status online? Or should I book a flight that doesn't have a stopover in America? Sorry if this is not an appropriate question for this sub, couldn't find any info pertaining to my case online. Thanks a lot in advance."

Is there anyone from Europe or even better France here?   
My F1 visa is expiring in a week and I am currently doing OPT. It has been so long since I went back home, and I really need to go back. The thing is that I know I would not be able to to come back here though with my expired visa. I know that I can stay here with an expired one as long as I have a valid I-20. The thing is that in France, an appointment can be scheduled only when being there already and a period of 10 days after travelling is required to get an appointment (COVID regulations). On top of that, appointments are scarce and 2 to 4 weeks are needed to receive the visa is confirmed. This means that I would have to stay in France for at least 5 to 6 weeks. The thing is that I am looking for a job and I have other responsibilities here, so I cannot leave for that long. Has anyone been in this situation? Did you find another way to renew your visa?"

I want to do my Phd in Cybersecurity. My GPA in masters is  3.91 but I have no publications or thesis,  which is why I decided, enrolling in a masters Cybersecurity program and then converting that into a PhD is the best choice for me (spoke to couple of professors).

I came back to my country in 2018. Took a year off for my health problem (life-long auto immune health condition).Tutored undergrad students for their grad admission competitive examinations, bridged my computer science knowledge in JAVA, algorithms etc., bought a piece of land and started construction of a commercial building (my parents and I are equal owners of this property).

My visa interview will be in 2 months. I took a loan and have some liquid funds of mine and my parents (which in total will be more than the i20 amount). I took a loan for my first masters and paid off the loan in 2018. My father is a doctor and he runs his own diagnostics business. My parents own lots of land and buildings in the city and outside.

I do not wish to work in the US this time either and will return home immediately after my Phd. Will teach as a assistant professor at a good university in my city,  work as a Cybersecurity consultant for private companies and assist my parents in taking care of the real estate etc. 

Not working a corporate job like other masters graduates, a gap since 2018, and applying for a second masters instead of a Phd.  Are these gonna affect my f1 visa?

1) Could I just set my start date with my new employer to be October 13th, even if I won't have gotten my STEM OPT application approved by them, and I won't have worked for that employer previously?

2) Alternatively, could I set my start date to be something like October 27th and accrue a couple weeks of unemployment between my positions?

( He kept my passport). Although all of my friends received their visas from the post office within three days, I still haven't got mine. Furthermore, when I checked my CEAC status page on Monday (26 July), I realized my status updated into ""Refused."" From what I learned, it is means I stuck at AP. However, until today, I haven't got an email about additional information, etc. Also, on my application page, it says that "" *This applicant has no 221g history.* "" I am admitted to the Ph.D. program with a full scholarship. I don't have any criminal record and also don't have a generic name. I don't know what is wrong with my application. Have you guys ever experienced something like this? I have to be in the U.S within two weeks, so I am really worried and frustrated about all of this process. Nobody responds to my emails, and since I don't have my passport, I cant apply f1-visa again.

**TLDR:** During the interview, the consular told me my application is approved and he kept my passport, but my status is ""Refused,"" right now.

**Update:** Finally they returned my query and this is what I got:

""Your application is under review at this time. We will complete your process as soon as the review is complete.""

Not sure whether this is a good sign or not. Also they didnt specify my situation as AP. I have no idea why my process took so long.

My current school says they are willing to release the SEVIS record in completed status, however the new school says they won't accept it in completed status. The only solution both of them agreed to was recommending me to leave US as soon as possible and renter with my existing visa ( which is valid till 2023) and my new initial I-20 (which the new school agreed to process and sent it to me), but they still don't guarantee I won't face any issues at the port of entry because its entirely at the discretion of the CBP officer.

Getting a new student Visa at my home country is out of question due to COVID situation in my country. People have been waiting for 2 months for VISA appointments with nothing going on , so its impossible get one and return within Aug 18th when my school starts. I have the option to defer to next semester but I will lose my stipend and scholarships. However, department said they might be able to extend it to Fall 2022. I can also defer the admission of another university to next semester but they don't promise any TA stipend in Spring either.

I have huge student loans ($80,000) and I'm supposed to start paying them off from next month onwards, which is impossible with the income from my home country. 

The way I see it, I have 2 options - Either go back to my home country and re-enter with my current Visa and New I-20 , OR , go back to another country to renew my visa and renter with my new I-20 within 18 days. Which is the best option that'll allow me rentry to US by the CBP officer? How can I convince the officer to allow me to enter the US and what are my chances?

From 1st of Aug, an exception was made for F1 Visas. Now, if it includes students on OPTs or not hasn't been made clear. Sure, a lot of people on the internet and even my DSO thinks that exempt extends to me, but no one is a 100% sure. 

Now the two potential risks I face are traveling from a banned country whose vaccination might not even be recognized in the states. And the immigration risk being outside the country for more than 6 months and VISA &amp; OPT dates approaching quickly. My h1B was t selected in the lottery 

The measures I'm taking to make sure I won't get denied entry are : 

*For Covid reasons* 

1. Fully vaccinated (Covishield) with certificate
2. Negative RTPCR test 

*For immigration reasons*

1. The usual documentation (i20, visa)
2. An employer verification letter stating I'm still with the company and my employer's details and contact information. 
3. Paystubs
4. Offer Letter
5. Status Verification Letter provided by my DSO that I reported and verified my current status as it shows on the i20. This is only valid for the following 20 days from the date it's requested. I went to Marshall, WV and I don't know if all universities do this.

I had worries about being denied entry at the cbp in the airport but it all went great, no issues. Many of you answered my questions regarding using an old unexpired visa and a copy of my original i20 with a different sevis id. 
I can confirm, for anyone who’s in a similar situation that you can enter the US with:
- a printed signed copy of your original I20 (make sure you sign in though)
- an unexpired F1 Visa that shows a different sevis id.
If you plan on switching schools talk to your DSO about so they can transfer your sevis id, I didn’t because I’m returning my old school."

2. Am I legally allowed to stay in the US until the H1B is approved?

&amp;#x200B;

So my F1 visa got rejected for the first time a few weeks back , So this happened which I feel lead to the rejection.. So The visa officer asked me to show my father's income tax returns when I told him his(my father's) annual income. I did show him the Income Tax Returns but it seems that he wasn't familiar with the format of it so he straightaway gave those papers back and rejected me(which i felt was kinda unfair), Those were not any fake/forged papers . I had got them from the Indian Income Tax Department Website. So in a few weeks I have my second attempt coming up , I am confused as to what should I say when the officer asks me ""What went wrong last time? / Why were you rejected ?"" OR ""What changes have you made since your last attempt?""  unable to figure out a positive sounding answer(can't blame the Visa officer  though even if he/she is wrong). The reason I am confused is because He(The Officer in the first attempt) didn't even ask any thing except 1)What does my father do? 2)Annual Income? 3)Show me his income tax returns. didn't even ask me how am I funding or whatsoever. Any help/suggestions would be really appreciated.

After the interview, I discovered that I was wrong about how long I was studying at the university, it was only 7 months! this made me quite nervous because lying on a visa interview could me inadmissible to enter the US forever.

I started doing some research and I found out that you can get a bar on a willful misrepresentation of a ""material fact"" or fraud. Does this apply to me? First of all, I had no intention to lie and it doesn't make sense to lie about the duration of my university to deceive the officer so he could give me the visa.

The reason that I chose a community college is that I have a GED through which you can only get in two-year universities. And the reason I gave GED (Highschool Graduate Diploma) rather than other exams is that I shifted from the national curriculum of education in my country to the British curriculum and I gave GED as a backup in case any problem occurs. And a problem did occur in the form of Covid. Because of covid A-level exams were graded based on your past scores in the British curriculum which I did not have. 

**My question is will my Visa get rejected just because I am in a community college? And If they ask my future plans what should I tell them?**

My current plans are to get a bachelors degree after transferring credits to a 4-year institution if they are offering a scholarship or else I will go to an EU country where they offer free education to international students in case somebody is wondering my parents will be providing me with living expenses for the tenure when I stay abroad. And my future work plans are to do a start-up in my home country. Should I tell the interviewing officer these plans? I am confused because in quora people said to answer them that I am going to transfer because most people do transfer from community colleges and the officer is looking whether one would answer truthfully or not.

But my friend today gave his interview and was rejected and he said that he is looking to transfer towards a bachelors degree. It is not clear that this was the reason for his rejection or not but it said denial under section 214(b).

My plan is to apply for OPT then switch to the appropriate visa later on. Just wanna confirm I can be an independent contractor on OPT, and get advice on better options if any.

Whilst on my F1 visa I engaged into unauthorised work at a local golf club as a waiter. I have a few questions: 1) As this is a violation of my non immigrant visa, I was wondering if I had accrued unlawful presence time whilst working, even though I was never caught and have since left the country and returned on a new F1 visa? (I am an MBA candidate) And also, as I engaged in unauthorised work, have violated my non immigrant visa, and potentially accrued unlawful presence in the U.S. 

2) Will this impact my case at all? I have read on numerous sites and blogs that all of the above mentioned are forgiven for spouses of USC’s, so any insight would be great. 

I worked for 6 months unauthorised, but under 180 days if that has an impact at all."

I’m in my last term and the last date of my course is this December. My DSO now tells me that they have no option to add a dependent to my student record as to quote her “she thinks this is because this is my last term”. 

I was hoping to have my spouse extend his stay here by applying for a COS and when I asked what the process was to apply for a dependent I-20 this was the response. She also claimed that she had never seen anything like this in the many years that she’s worked - I find this very surprising and unlikely as it does not seem to be a unique ask by any means. It also seems far-fetched to imagine that students on F1 on OPT would not be able to have their dependents join them here in the States considering that they would have completed their course of study by then.

I have spoken to an attorney regarding this and when I mentioned this - she claimed that since an attorney does not have access to the SEVIS portal (which is true obviously) that he was wrong in telling me that there was no such timeline for requesting a dependent to be added to my record as long my F1 status remains active and I’m in good standing.

Might be a little long but please bear with me, I need any advice or experience on this as possible. 

I've been on the F1 since undergrad in the US. Because of COVID, after I came to the US for my senior year, I haven't gone back since. I am now about to start a graduate program in a different institution. My visa expired after my graduation, and to keep my status here, I have done a SEVIS transfer to my new institution and have a valid I-20 now with my new institution. Now, I would like to go back to my home country for winter break, or summer break, or whatever (I would just like to be able to go home). I understand that once I leave the country, since my visa is expired, once I leave the US, I'll need a new visa to re-enter. That's fine. I've been in contact with a visa agency in my country and they have been helping me in this process. Now, the agency tells me I need to file an extension of my status (i think its a I-539 form), so that I can show the embassy, when I apply for renewal of my student visa, that I have a document that shows that I have been here on a legal status and whatnot. I contact the university multiple times and they tell me I do not need an extension of my status, and that I am in fact under a legal status only with my SEVIS transfer and my up-to-date I-20, which will make me eligible for my visa renewal/ new application.. The university even maintains that the form is only if I am changing my status from another visa type to an F-1, which I am not. The agency stands firm that I have to do this extension form. 

Does anyone have any experience with this? The information I keep getting are inconsistent -- on the one hand the university says I am good to go the way I am, and on the other, the agency from my home country maintains that I should file this form. Has anyone had to do this after staying in the country past visa expiration date while having a valid SEVIS/I-20 in a new institution?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm on an F1, my program starts on the 2nd of September. Currently in India. 

I had booked a flight on emirates that goes via Athens. I checked their website today morning and came across a note that says the flight via Athens is only for US nationals, residents and their spouses.

Would anyone happen to have more information on transiting through the Schengen region from India? 

I was told by the airlines that I need to possess a NIE in order to qualify for the flight. I believe all F1 visas qualify under the NIE at the moment. I checked my visa, there was no mention of an NIE on the visa itself.

I’ve been studying in the US for 5 years now. On track to graduate next year with a degree in Computer Engineering. This entire time I have been extremely focused on academic trying to get the best grades possible and get the the best projects to put on resume, which hopefully will lead to job prospects in the US. In retrospective, I have also missed out a lot when it comes to experiencing new cultures and trying different experiences that I would otherwise never get in my home country. 

And more often than not, whenever I take my mind off of school, I suddenly feel really out of place. My surroundings doesn’t seem real to me. The questions I keep having in my head when this happens is why am I here? What is the point? Essentially, I question stuff that I have done over the years if they would mean anything. When I was in that state of mind, I feel left behind, confused, and lost. Maybe this is reality and I’m not a part of it.

And I asked him which date should I update it to? He replied it could be any date it just has to be in the future. So by 19th August my school updated my i20 and SEVIS records to 25th august and gave me a late-arrival letter which had the date of 27th August. What should I do? It says refused since 18th august.

I'm an international student who's considering applying for a community collage in the computer science field in the US sometime in 2022.

I'm totally lost! I know nothing beside me wanting to study in the US. Which makes things like ""what to know"" and ""what to ask"" a lot harder but I'll try my best...

Here are some general questions that are at the top of my head but feel free to expand more as what I'm really seeking is a full insight about the whole process.

Which state/city is the go-to option for me as an international student?

Which US community collage do you recommend for the major of computer science (doesn't have to be ""THE BEST"" but at least someplace well-known)?

How much can I expect my average annual tuition to be?

What are my chances of receiving a scholarship (whether fully or partially-funded) from a US community collage? What factors can increase/decrease those chances (I'm guessing maybe previous education records... if so, is the a GED score that considered ""good"" for someone applying for a scholership)?

After completing my 2-years education, if I were to seek upgrading to a Bachelors degree, will I be starting the 4 years program from the get go or will I just need to put in extra two years?

Finally, is having the sufficient funding the only requirement to get enrolled or do colleges deny international students applications for other reasons? What can those other reasons include?"

t3_pdohl6,4,F1 resident alien student eligible for Obamacare (ACA)?,2021-08-29 04:12:12,"Hi, 

I am a resident alien F1 student in the US (resident alien because I have been here for 5+ years). My college requires us to enroll in the college health insurance plan; waiving out of college health insurance plan is possible if we have an equivalent insurance plan from elsewhere. 

I applied for ACA through the healthcare.gov website and got approved a subsidy for an insurance plan through the marketplace. Based on this marketplace plan I got, I was able to waive out of my college's insurance plan. 

I am now worried that enrolling for a subsidized insurance plan through the federal marketplace may be in violation of some immigration law. This concern stems from coming across the following webpage:
 https://www.salisbury.edu/administration/student-affairs/student-health-services/international.aspx

The webpage asserts that international students are not eligible for any ""public assistance"" and that in fact, accepting such assistance is in violation of immigration law. 

My question: is that assertion correct? Does enrolling in a subsidized ACA plan jeopardize my F-1 status? 

I have a few more days to enroll back into my college's insurance plan so I'm not completely screwed yet. Would be grateful for any responses/insights/links to relevant resources and/or clauses in the relevant immigration law.

However, I only received the email from SEVP to create the account today (which is 93 days since the start date of my OPT). I also received another email from my school almost the same time today saying that I accrued more than 90 days of unemployment and that I need to update my employment information asap.

However, when I tried to update the employer information myself, I couldn't enter the start date because it has been more than 10 days since I started, and was informed by the portal that I need assistance from DSO to update it. I was panic so I called/emailed my DSO but those emails (both from school and SEVP) arrived at 4pm on Friday so my DSO didn't pick up the phone. Now I have to wait until next week but I'm really anxious about my situation. Has my SEVIS record been terminated? Should I update my employment record anyway but use a different day (within 10 days from today) so that it stops the clock of my failure to report?

P/s: My DSO updated it. Thanks everyone!"

t3_pi5qql,21,Program completion date for F1-OPT,2021-09-05 03:38:54,"Hi, I am a PhD student who plans to graduate this Fall, and I got a job offer lined up next Spring.   


If my dissertation defense goes well, I will meet the degree conferral date in late December. If I understand correctly, I can only initiate the EAD(i-765) application up to 90 days of the ""program completion date"".

Here comes the tricky part. My TA contract actually ends next January, two weeks after the degree conferral date. The DSO in my university insisted that the end date of TA contract instead of degree conferral date should be the ""program completion date"". The two-week difference can be fatal since I will be out of income before receiving my EAD. USCIS is highly unpredictable whose process time can be a lot longer than 90 days while only allowing to file the  EAD(i-765) application up to 90 days of the ""program completion date"". Can the degree conferral date be ""program completion date"" in my case?  


What's worse, I learned that the USCIS processed with substantial delays during the pandemic. As of now, I am really unsure what date would be the exact date I can receive the EAD. This is important for me because I will need to receive the EAD at my current residence, notify my current landlord to terminate the lease, book a flight to another state, and book a temporary residence in another state. Too much uncertainties involve here."

Needless to say this is extremely frustrating and I'm uncertain how to book my flights now and what to expect? The quarter starts on Sep 27th. I'm also finding contradicting infos online regarding the meaning of this ""administrative processing"".

""Your application for a U.S. visa has been approved. In about 7 days, you will be notified by email and SMS once the passport is ready for collection from the service provider's pick-up center or delivery via UPS (premium delivery).""

t3_pk2oze,4,"DSOs, how many times have you granted an extension for a student?",2021-09-08 03:35:03,I volunteer at the International Office at my school and just today I witnessed a case where the school’s DSO wouldn’t issue an extension for an undergraduate student. The student had already had an extension granted at the end of 2020 as her program end date was listed on her I20 and her reason was that she added a minor. Currently she requested another extension for one more semester as her current program end date is the end of 2021 but she still has to take the second part of senior design starting in January. The DSO denied the request and his reasoning was that the student should have taken the first part of senior design over the summer so she could take the second part in the current fall semester and finish on time for the listed program end date. I was very confused and that didn’t sound like a good reason to deny an extension and the student had a compelling academic reason as to the need for the extension but I couldn’t say that to the DSO so I’m over here asking for second opinions. The DSO in specific started back in 2018 and his supervisor is the PDSO and I suggested the student contacted the PDSO directly

[https://www.uscis.gov/laws-and-policy/other-resources/class-action-settlement-notices-and-agreements/notice-of-consent-order-providing-interim-relief-to-certain-applicants-filing-form-i-765-for-opt](https://www.uscis.gov/laws-and-policy/other-resources/class-action-settlement-notices-and-agreements/notice-of-consent-order-providing-interim-relief-to-certain-applicants-filing-form-i-765-for-opt)

The DSO in my school said according to the consent order, the relief provided by the consent order only applies to the student whose OPT application got delayed last year. Therefore, it would not serve me well, as a prospective first-time applicant. In other words, the DSO thinks the 120-day window does not apply to me and I could get rejected due to outside the 90-day window. Nevertheless, the DSO replied that I am still welcomed to file the i-765 application now at my own risk of rejection.

It seems that eventually I just asked the DSO a dumb question and nothing could be changed.

My question is: does applying OPT outside of the typical 90-day window constitute a reason of rejection? I mean I am not trying to apply like 1 year or 6 months ahead, just a frugal less than 120 days ahead. The one month difference means a lot to me since the DSO said the school would NOT receive EAD for me. I literally have to ask my current landlord this favor."

After this, I changed my major to Master's in Statistics which is effective in Fall 2021. During this time period (in the last three years and Fall 2021 semester) I have always been in active status as an F-1 student.

Since there are only two courses left for me to finish my new degree, Fall 2021 is both my first and final semester as a Statistics major. In addition to this, I am using a part-time CPT as a Statistics major this semester. Both of the programs that I studied (PhD in Management and MS in Statistics) did not require doing an internship in their curriculum.

I have the following questions regarding post-completion OPT application:

1. International students are not allowed to participate in CPT in the first semester in the degree program unless the program requires it. Does using a part-time CPT even though I have not studied Statistics for an academic year can create a reason for USCIS to reject my OPT application?  Is there a possibility that this will be interpreted as a “Day 1 CPT” and cause a problem during the application process?
2. As far as I understand, once a work-authorization such as OPT is used in a higher education level, it cannot be used for a lower education level. Does the same rule apply when a CPT is used at a higher education level and impact the eligibility for OPT at a lower education level? In other words, does using a full-time CPT for three months at the PhD level would violate any master’s level post-completion OPT eligibility?

I’m a Korean born citizen with an expired F-1 visa but a valid I-20 form, and an approved STEM OPT with EAD. I’m looking to take two weeks off of my work and go home to see family and renew my F-1 visa. 

1. Do you guys see any general concerns?

As indicated on the webpage, quoted as follows: ""these flexibilities have been extended to include applications received on or after Oct. 1, 2020, through Oct. 31, 2021, inclusive"".  


I visited the international center several times and discussed with the DSOs. They insist the consent order doesn't apply to first-time applicants like me. They said they welcome my application if I was willing to take the risk of rejection. Then I filed the request for OPT I-20 again. This time, as replied in an email I received today, they just pretended as if the consent order never exist and asked me to wait until less than 90 days before program completion.  


I got a few replies from fellow international students applying OPT I-20 from other schools, their DSOs all showed supportive attitude on making good use of the extended timeframe of the consent order. Small sample size but it seems I am the only one out of luck here.

The situation is so outrageous. Enough is enough. Fortunately this will be the last time I have to deal with them before graduation."

Thank you for contacting the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Information Center.  


Students who have a valid (unexpired) F or M visa that was originally used for a different school or program can generally return to the United States with the same visa, even if the visa annotation has outdated information (e.g., school name, program dates, or SEVIS number). The student must have a Form I-20 with the current information.  


Students should consult their Designated School Official prior to traveling. For further assistance, students can contact the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP). The SEVP manages schools and nonimmigrant students and their dependents in the F and M visa classifications on behalf of the Department of Homeland Security. Contact information can be found at [https://www.ice.gov/sevis/contact](https://www.ice.gov/sevis/contact).  


Thank you again for contacting our office.

My funding will again be renewed in Fall 2022 for the complete academic year which is not a issue. 

But I ran into this situation, for my Spring 2022 i20, I had to show my own funding for the rest of the amount as the i20 has the cost details for one entire year, which I did, to get the i20.

2) I do not have a job offer but I am planning to select my starting date as February 1st which is 45 days after my graduation. 

I have the following questions regarding these two decisions:

1)  Is there any potential problem or risk of sending my OPT application two months before graduation date instead of an earlier time? Some people are telling me that in case there is a problem with my application or if USCIS rejects my application, I will not going to have enough time to send them the requested documents or re-file my application and the grace period might end before the approval. Is it true that I am taking any kind of risk by filing my application on October 17th instead of an earlier time?

I just got delayed because of the pandemic, otherwise I likely would have finished school.

Otherwise I would not be seeing my family for 6++ (!!) years. I don't want to wait until I file for OPT either because that can cause extra complications for traveling etc. 

Anyone been in a similar situation before? It seems fairly straightforward but I am still getting anxious.  Particularly I am afraid that they ""may"" require an in person interview which seems to take AGES to schedule and I would be stuck there for months.

t3_q35hf4,2,Second OPT application.,2021-10-07 09:41:07,"Hi all,

I'm an international student pursuing a second master's program. Long story short, my OPT application was denied for my first master's program and I was already out of my grace period; so I couldn't apply for it again. I had overstayed for 62 days after which I exited and re-entered the country on a new SEVIS record to start my second master's program. I'm in my last quarter and I'll apply for OPT in the coming days. But I'm not quite sure about some of the details. Because the associated SEVIS record with my current master's program is a new one-

&amp;#x200B;

1. Do I treat Form I-765 like I am filing for post-completion OPT for the very first time? For example, Part 2, Question 12 asks you whether you have previously filed Form I-765.
2. One of the required documents in the application packet is ""Photocopies of all previous I-20s"". Do I only send in my I-20s from my current master's program? Or do I include the ones from my previous master's program as well?

My DSO suggests that I treat I-765 like it's the first time I'm filing it. But they also suggested that I send in the I-20s from my previous master's program as well, **even the OPT I-20 from last time**.

What worries me is that it says ""Requesting one year of work authorization"" on the OPT I-20 from my first master's program. And it'd be contradictory if I answered 'No' on Part 2, Question 12.

Would it help if I sent in all my I-20s from both my master's programs (**including the previous OPT I-20**) and attached a letter explaining why there's an older OPT I-20 in my application packet? In that case, I'm going to have to answer 'Yes' to Part 2, Question 12, correct?

Or, do I just **not** send in the OPT I-20 from my first master's program, but send in the other I-20s from the same?

Thank you in advance for reading my post and/or answering the questions. I appreciate it a lot!"
t3_q3c24w,0,What are the chances of my visa getting rejected?,2021-10-07 15:52:33,"I gave my interview on August 18th. My program start date was 1st August and my class start date was 25th August. I had a late-arrival letter with me which allowed me to enter the US before 25th.

After my interview, the VO told me he is going to approve my visa but I have to do one thing which is to tell my school to update my SEVIS records and I20 to a future date so that I do not have any problem during port-of-entry. And I asked him which date should I update it to? He replied it could be any date it just has to be in the future. So on 19th August, my school updated my i20 and SEVIS records to 25th august.  

As the VO told me to email them after I receive my new I20 which should have a future date. After emailing them they did not reply until 23rd august and told me that they will let me know as soon as an update comes on my visa status. On 24th August they said to defer it to the next semester or shift my classes to a later date because it would not be possible for me to enter the USA by 25th August. The later was not possible for my school, so they suggested to defer and they will give me my new I-20 in October. And I told the embassy about that and they said to email them the New I-20 as soon as I get it. Also, they said previously that if I submit them a new I-20 by August 2022 I would not have to get a new DS-160 nor have to pay the MRV fee again.

**So I submitted the new I-20 to them. But I am worried if there is a possibility that my visa could get rejected? Honestly, I would not mind giving another interview but they have not said anything about giving another interview when I asked them about it they said for now just submit us the new I-20?**"

However, my passport doesn’t mention X and shows my place of birth as Y. Y is actually a sub-region inside X.   To complicate matters, my “state of birth” has changed due to redrawing of boundaries.  In the additional information section, I’ve written “My place of birth is X (on passport) which is located in the city of Y (on i20)” but did not attach any documentation to support this point. Of course, googling Y shows it in X on wiki page.  I’ve addressed the second point as “My state of birth has changed due to redrawing of boundaries since issuance of my passport”. Again, no evidence, but Google can give the evidence. All this is public information. Is this mismatch reason enough for rejection/RFE? Please suggest if you’ve faced these issues."

How does TAL work? If my topic is on the list, am I automatically rejected for F1-visa? I know that HEP/theoretical-physics students have to go through administrative processing due to TAL.

t3_q8zcmh,4,Can I work full time with an OPT if I'm a dissertator?,2021-10-15 22:45:58,"I just interviewed for a position where they would need me to start full-time ASAP (I know that I still have to apply for an OPT and that could take up to 90 days) if they extended an offer. 

About me:

* I'm doing a PhD in a STEM field
* I have finished all degree requirements for my PhD except the dissertation. I finished course work at the end of last year. I will probably finish my dissertation late Spring 2022
* I have an F1 and all the restrictions that come with it

Based on what I see on the USCIS website, I can see that you can only work up to 20 hours during the academic year with a pre-completion OPT. However, I stumbled upon [this](https://isss.uconn.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/76/2016/05/ISSS_344_OPT_Guidelines.pdf) document (not my university) that says that dissertators don't have that restriction and can apply for full-time pre- or post-completion OPT. Post allows for the 24-month STEM extension while pre doesn't, and apparently you have to finish the pre-completion OPT **before** finishing your dissertation (which does not work for me as this job would continue after graduation). Subsequently, I found [this](https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/document/presentations/I-765-OPT-Overview.ppt) powerpoint from USCIS which says:

Post-completion OPT enables F-1 students to work full-time 

https://preview.redd.it/nw3yjqe50pt71.png?width=913&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=781c0e0cba4c312caadad79279710f449276de6b

I'm guessing that for doctoral students, this implies 60 days after they finish their last course? This would be way more than 60 days for me. But then on [this](https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/students-and-exchange-visitors/optional-practical-training-opt-for-f-1-students) page, they say 60 days after finishing the **degree** (which I have not finished) up to 90 days before finishing (I will not be finished in 90 days).

So my questions are:

* Does what I wrote sound right? Am I missing anything?
* Am I eligible for any OPT based on this?

I know I'm jumping the gun as I may not even be offered the position but the OPT application process can take so long that I'm anxious. I have messaged my international student advisor and am planning on dropping in at Monday's office hours but I just wanted to see if anyone on this sub had any insight based on experience or knowledge.

After this, I changed my major to master's in Statistics which is effective in Fall 2021. This semester I am graduating with my master's and my DSO told me that I should write that CPT as a master's level CPT in my I-765 Form Additional Information section for my Post-Completion OPT application. The reason of this is they told me that my SEVIS immigration record reflects that full-time CPT during the Summer as master's level. I have the following questions regarding my post-completion OPT:

1. Should I write that CPT as a master's level CPT in my application even though I was a PhD student while I was participating? I don't want to be in a situation where I am giving false information in my application but according to the screenshot of my SEVIS record they have sent me, that CPT is at master's level in the system.

My EAD card start date is Jan 10, 2021 and EAD card end date will be Jan 9, 2022. I started my employment on Jan 15, 2021 and I am now applying to a graduate program. I plan to transfer my SEVIS while on OPT to obtain the new I-20 as soon as possible. However, I know that if I transfer my SEVIS to another school, my employment authorization will end the day my record is transferred.

t3_qci58l,2,Major concern about OPT,2021-10-21 03:11:14,"Hello everyone, 

I am on OPT starting from September 03, 2021 and currently unemployed. I graduated from a nursing program back in August and my initial plan was to take the NCLEX (Nursing Licensure Exam) in September but I did not receive my ATT (Authorization to Test) until the end of September so I had to schedule my exam on October. I did my test yesterday and felt like I failed. I'm VERY much worried about failing because I cannot retest for another 45 days which is way past the 90-day unemployment window and I surely, definitely do not want to violate my status. 

I will not be eligible to work as a nurse if I did fail the NCLEX. USCIS stated that your job should be related to the field you studied or else it is a violation of your status. So if for any reason I had to wait 45 days to retest again, can I work as a patient care technician or any jobs that closely resembles the responsibilities of a nurse?"

However, I am currently doing my study abroad in France and need to renew my VISA as it is going to expire before I return to the US to finish my graduation.

Three questions:

Do I need a new I-20 form and pay the SEVIS Fee again? I already have an I-20 with an expiration date with the current end date of my studies, as I had to do a new one when returning to school after my gap semester.


Do you know how much time they will give me on the new VISA? Will it be just until the end date of my studies, or will it be for four years? (I know that that doesnt mean that I will be able to stay for all that time without work or education, but it will allow me to travel out of the US while on OPT)

Either me or my school is making a stupid mistake and I need your opinion.

July 16th, I got an email from my ISS that my OPT recommendation is under review.

July 20th, I got an email for the approval &amp; issuance of OPT recommendation, new I-20 and program update (I've also changed my I-20 from doctorate to master's, put the request at the same time with OPT request)

August 9-10th, I had appointments with ISS advisors, as I was also assuming they calculated 30 day time window from July 20th. I have screenshots of the meeting and meeting notes from SEVIS coordinator of my ISS. They have mentioned that I should file this by 18th for the payment to be processed on 19th of August.

I compeleted my filing on August 13th, checked for fee waiver application option but decided not to apply and submitted finally on August 17th.

Last week, I got response from USCIS saying that I submitted on Aug 17th but my recommendation to SEVP was on July 16th. My DSO is saying that he sent me an email about it on July 20th and at the bottom of the email it was saying July 16th. Our webinars, my meetings mention as 30 days after the issuance of I-20.

A negligence on my part led me to prepare to leave the country as soon as possible.

So, I left the US on 28th August 2018, after talking to my academic advisors and multiple visits to the DSO's office and talking to an immigration lawyer since they said I had no chance of getting reinstated on a valid F1 and trying to apply for a reinstatement would only accrue unlawful presence on my F1 visa.

I  am now planning to apply to another graduate program in the US and am hoping to get admitted for the next Fall Session(2022). I would like to know if my previous record of overstay is going to affect my chances of getting another F1 visa. What advice would you offer to me in this scenario?

I am worried that my overstay record will deny me further opportunities to pursue graduate schools in the US."

I graduated with a Bachelor of Architecture degree in May 2020. I have been working for the past 1.5 years as a Project Engineer for a construction company. I feel extremely unfulfilled and want to pursue a career switch in the design industry where my heart truly lies. I have been applying to a lot of graphic design and UI/UX jobs and got a few interviews. I am hesitant to pursue this any further as I haven't heard back from my DSO yet. I can obviously explain very easily how a job in graphic design is directly related to architecture as that's more than 50% of our curriculum.

It is my fault as I understand that the past few months I haven't been delivering as much as I should have. My supervisor/boss requested me to enroll into a Masters program in the Spring 2022 Semester, which I am unsure if possible. But if so, I want to know how. Based on what I have searched, it seems that when I enroll into an academic program while my OPT is ongoing the OPT is terminated and I am issued a new i-20 but I am not sure if this is for Post-completion only or also applies for STEM OPT. 

I was only told about this a week or so ago and my plans were to apply for Masters for Fall 2022, but my boss is recommending me to visit the Deans at the nearby universities to see if I could do a late enrollment. I will visit the schools and network with the professors and try speaking with the Deans but I don't know if they will take a student for the Spring semester this late in the admission process. I have been working since September 2019; Post-completion and STEM Extension, so I think I have about 150 days worth of permitted unemployment (Jan 1, 2022 - May 31, 2022). I have signed up with a placement agency that will provide some training within my academic domain and try to place me in a role. This training starts in December. I have heard that this takes about a few months to land a job. 

If I am laid-off or quit mid January, I have till May to find a temporary job that lasts until September when my STEM OPT ends. Unemployment sucks. But I am not low on savings, and feel I could possibly even improve my GRE score and meet a larger number of prerequisites for my intended Masters program by taking some college classes. That being said I definitely will need to plan out what I intend to get out of those few months and would prefer being employed. Have any of you faced a similar predicament or know anyone who did? What did you/they do to stay in status?"

However, my family all live in my home country, so all their income or disability benefits they receive are outside of the US. 

I have documents (translated tax returns of my main sponsor) to demonstrate the income level, but my question is: is it risky to apply for a waiver?

I was looking to apply for part-time status since I only need that 1 class, also helps that I will be paying reduced tuition so why not. 

The issue here is I have a job offer at an accounting firm and I would require 150 units in order to be CPA eligible (which I am 3 classes short). I had asked my DSO if I could take those 3 classes at a CC by applying for concurrent enrollment during my final term as a part-time student; they said yes. Turns out they meant classes that are required to complete the major at my 4-year university, not just any classes I would like to take, so it's a no at the end.

Is that true? Am I screwed now?"

t3_qppopj,17,"HELP: Unauthorized Reduced Course Load Termination, Post-Completion OPT",2021-11-08 23:02:07,"I found out on Thursday last week that my school's DSO is terminating my F-1 status as a result of an unauthorized RCL back in Spring 2020. I took 14 credit hour worth of classes but at the very end (week before finals) due to regulations surrounding COVID I was able to drop the class as it was a team project based class and my team was failing (members dropped the class, etc). 

I dropped the class instead of letting it fail as I didn't fully realize that it wasn't the right decision to make at the time. The drop brings my semester credit down to 11 credit hours, and my advisor greenlit this. Unfortunately the consequences came last week when I submitted my OPT recommendation application and my DSO reviewed the case to find that past violation.

My F-1 status is set to terminate in Friday (11/12) and I'd have to leave the US by then. From what I gathered about reinstating my status, so far I think I have 2 options: file Form I-539 with USCIS or travel and reentry with new F-1.

I'm graduating this December with a program end date on 12/22/2021 and would want to continue with post-completion OPT. If I go the first route, I have seen processing times quoted as 4-10 months, while I recall that OPT applications are supposed to be in no more than 60 days after program completion date. So my question is: if I were to get reinstated, how does that affect my application for OPT, i.e. can I still apply for OPT or will be reinstatement be worthless as it is past the deadline for application?

If I go the second route, I will need to be in the school for at least 1 academic year before becoming eligible for post-completion OPT. I was not planning on going to graduate school but now I'm seriously considering that possibility as well.

Any help would be appreciated!"

t3_qr67mu,3,Issue with Externship and Misinformation from School,2021-11-10 22:38:49,"So today I have a rather interesting issue, with the brother of a friend (let's name him Harry). Harry goes to a culinary school in Hyde Park, NY (You can guess which it is). He started his associate's in Fall 2019. He completed that semester but ""Failed"" his Spring 2020 semester because of COVID. The school shut down 3 weeks early from the end of the semester at which point he had all A's and one B+ in classes. His school restarted those 3 weeks in August 2020 (three weeks prior to the official Fall 2020 semester), for which he was not in the USA and was unwilling to come to the USA. It makes sense as his classes would be in person and no one at the time was vaccinated. His school verbally told him he could do those 3 weeks online and later went back against their word and said ""you must be present IRL to pass"". - **Problem 1, Was this done so they get can away without refunding for classes? From a legal standpoint can they say X and do Y that is completely opposite to X?**  


So now, Harry continues his studies this Fall, Fall 2021 (started in September) on a new I-20 but the same F-1 visa on this passport. He has been in contact with his ISSS/ISA throughout COVID and his study plan was changed due to the interruption of the pandemic. Harry has to study for an extra semester and the school prepared his study plan including the semester in which he has to do an externship, which was set for Spring 2022. He was even emailed multiple times by his advisor at the time to find an externship for next semester. Now, Harry has procured an externship at a 2-Michelin star and his dream restaurant. His advisor was fired on November 5th and the ISSS/ISA is now telling him that he cannot do an externship without 2 consecutive semesters at the campus. - **Problem 2, Was this just negligence/incompetence? Does Harry have any legal grounds to fight back at his school? Does the break during COVID (school was 100% closed from April - August for everyone) mean he is starting a new program in the eyes of the I-20?**  


Following this, Harry has another 3rd issue. He is afraid that if he is unable to undertake the externship at this restaurant, that they will put him on a blacklist for future applications. **Can an official letter from his school to the restaurant help? And how can Harry leverage his school to send such a letter?** From what I understand from Harry, his school administration treats international students as second class citizens and has very little regard for them. He is afraid to complain to the administration because they will issue a ""demerit"" for unprofessional behaviour that directly affects his grades.   


Please advice. Any suggestions or guidance is greatly appreciated. Although it doesn't affect me directly, I can't stand bullies who are held unaccountable. I have spoken to at least 7 other international students at his school, and Harry is not the only one facing this issue. They were all told the same. I am genuinely surprised by how scared they are of their school's administration. When I did my undergrad in NJ, the student body could tell the administration to F off and there would be no repercussions."

I’m currently on my initial post completion OPT visa after finishing my B.S in Mech Eng earlier this year. 

I am considering applying for software engineering and web developer roles next year and I was wondering if in the case I get a job offer, would I be able to qualify for my STEM OPT Extension when I apply for it?(since my major wasn’t exactly CS in college)

This is because the USCIS rules mention that my work has to be directly related to my major area of study. Also I’ve heard that for the STEM OPT extension, they scrutinize your application and situation pretty heavily.

I did take a few coding classes in College and have used MATLAB, Python etc. in many other Mech Eng classes.

Do you think it would be possible for me to explain how the basic coding experience as well as the engineering mindset/knowledge I picked up in college helped prepare me for my software role? (I’m self-taught otherwise)

What do you think my chances are?

I have been looking for a F1 Dropbox appointment for about 3 months now but have had no luck. I was only able to 'see' available appointments once but they were too close to the current date. 

Basic info - 

Visa - F1 (Expired July 2020; graduated August 2020)

Currently on - STEM OPT (about 19 months remaining)

Eligible for dropbox 

**My questions are -**

\- Has anyone had luck finding these appointments recently?

\- Does anyone have any tips to increase my chances of finding this appointment? 

\- If I don't get a dropbox appointment but still want to go back to my home country. What is the best way to do this? 

Thanks!"
t3_qu9c66,2,Can my employer apply for my H1-B while on F1 CPT?,2021-11-15 05:47:05,"I'm currently in my senior year of college (Bachelor's degree) and have no Bachelor's degree prior to my current, ongoing one (which I know is a requirement for H1-B sponsorship).

My employer has given me a full-time job offer letter for when I graduate (May 2022). Currently, I'm interning for them part-time until I graduate on CPT. My initial plan was to just apply for OPT and my employer apply for my H1-B during my OPT period.

Is it possible, however, for them to apply for my H1-B while I still intern for them on CPT? ie. while I'm interning for them next semester, from Jan-May, they submit my H1-B sponsorship application in April (when H1-B applications open) while on CPT? Considering I graduate the month after, in May?

I plan on applying for OPT regardless of my potential H1-B application ofcourse. I don't know whether applying for H1-B will affect my OPT application or my F-1 visa status, in either scenarios of me being selected or not selected in the H1-B lottery.

Thanks for all your help!"

MIS) was STEM-designated on their website when it is actually not according to the degree’s CIP code on my I-20. I realize my mistake now and am severely regretting it.

Today, I received a verbal job offer from a company willing to sponsor for a F1-OPT, dependent that I have the OPT-STEM extension. Should I negotiate with the company and ask them to sponsor me for a H1B instead?

My program end date is May 2022. The company offers a start date of June or July 2022. I was thinking of requesting my OPT to begin on July 2022 to allow for 90 days of post-OPT unemployment in Jul 2023 when my OPT expires, wherein early 2023 I would ask that the company file a H1B application on my behalf in April 2023 to allow a H1B start date of October 2023.

Has anyone gone through this situation before with only a 1-year F1-OPT and can advise on how I should relay this timeline to the company considering my offer? For more context, I am eligible for the H1B1 visa and could try for the cap-exemption for the first year. The offer is within technology services consulting.

I recently lost my passport containing my F-1 Visa in the US. I immediately filed for a new passport and received it today. 

I don’t have any form of state ID. I hadn’t applied for any before losing my passport and my passport is my only form of legal ID in the US.

I have all the documents required for getting my state ID as an F-1 student in the US, except the visa. The visa can only be stamped the next time I travel outside of the US, which isn’t anytime soon.

Can the DMV officers make an exception if I bring my new passport, I-94, I-20 and all other required documents? Along with my police report regarding the lost passport? I understand that the I-94 was issues to my old passport number, so is there anyway I can transfer it over to my new one? I have photocopies of all my lost documents as well.

t3_qxiawq,1,Multiple internships,2021-11-19 15:14:03,"Hi everyone, 

I’m currently a senior and graduating in coming May. I had an internship during last summer and had a CPT for it. That employer asked me to stay during Fall and I was able to sign up for another internship course through my school and get part-time CPT for this fall semester. Now the same employer is asking if I can stay during the spring too. Both of my CPTs were for different roles and different courses through school. So I didn’t repeat the same internship class, but rather second one was an elective internship and the first one was required as part of the curriculum. 

I’m planning to apply for OPT when I graduate and work with it. Would doing one more internship during the spring semester decrease my chances of getting OPT?

I’m planning to talk to my DSO soon about it too.

t3_r922bc,5,End of employment with an employer on STEM OPT - What do I have to report as a student and what does my former employer need to report?,2021-12-04 23:28:38,"Hello,

I recently came to the end of an employment opportunity. I reported my unemployment to my DSO and am currently back in job search. I submitted the final evaluation on my school's portal.

&amp;#x200B;

My former employer is relatively new to the STEM OPT process, so I just wanted to ensure that they are meeting their reporting requirements. I found some stuff online that indicates that when a student's employment ends before their authorized extension period, the employer has to inform the DSO as well.

&amp;#x200B;

But I am confused on whether this applies to this particular case. In the [diagram](https://studyinthestates.dhs.gov/assets/stemopt_reportingrequirements_greyscale.pdf), they seem to indicate that ""Report a change of student’s legal name, residential or mailing address, employer name or address, and/or loss of employment to DSO "" is the responsibility of the student alone. The ""loss of employment"" applies in this case.

&amp;#x200B;

On the other hand, [this](https://studyinthestates.dhs.gov/stem-opt-hub/employers-stem-opt-reporting-requirements) seems to indicate otherwise, requiring both the student and the employer to notify the DSO.

&amp;#x200B;

So which is it? Is my employer also required to inform my DSO, or is it sufficient for my final evaluation to be submitted by me?"

t3_rcsy37,9,SEVIS Termination,2021-12-09 22:24:22,"Hello, 
I have a very confusing situation &amp; would appreciate any pointers or information as to how to move forward. I recently went to my home country to renew my visa and was informed my Sevis was terminated. It’s a long read &amp; I apologize in advance. 
Here’s a little bit of back story: I finished my master in 2019 and was on opt in 2020. However, due to covid I couldn’t get a job on time. I had emailed the international office in my school severally to update them on the situation of things, whether or not the 90 days rule was extended and how to move forward. But the response I got were majorly diplomatic response(s) or no response at all. When I eventually got a job in September, I was issued a new I-20 and since I had a valid work permit I took the job. Though ICE sent a letter (which I didn’t receive on time) that I had 15days to report employment. I got the letter about 9 days after the stated date. I was also in conversation with my potential employer at that time but onboarding process took a while. I gave my DSO the information and documents from my potential employer pending when I get the offer letter but the DSO refused them. When I eventually got the offer letter, I forwarded to my DSO who issued a new I-20 and all seemed well. Fast forward to January this year, I transferred to a new school &amp; ended opt early.
However, on getting to my country for my interview, the visa officer said my Sevis was terminated in September 2020 &amp; also why I decided to do an MBA when I already have MA. I tried to explain my Sevis wasn’t terminated ( so I thought) while also responding to her other questions. I obviously didn’t get the visa and was also confused as to the termination she mentioned. I reached out to my current school who informed me I was in active status while also showing me proof. I got all necessary proof ready and went to another interview but I didn’t get the visa still. This time, when I tried to inquire reason for refusal stating that I had proof that my Sevis was active, he said “it’s not up for discussion” At this point, I went ahead to email my previous DSO to find out if my Sevis was at any point terminated. She responded saying it was terminated because I had a pending I-485 case with USCIS but was brought back to active status due to OPT. I became confused again as I never filed such. I went further to ask for clarification and she admitted my Sevis was terminated in error but that she reached out to SEVP to correct the error. I became very startled as I had tried to convince the visa officers my Sevis wasn’t terminated. I reach out to the DSO to email the consulate in my country to explain the situation but was told they didn’t find a contact person to reach out to in my country. I told them I’d look it up and provide any information I get so I can at least appear for another interview.

What do you advice/suggest on how to move forward."

t3_rluu7v,4,Proof of funding to bring dependents,2021-12-22 02:35:47,"Hi there. I am a PhD Student on F1 visa who has just arrived in the US and wants to bring my wife and two children to the US with me. Rules of the office of international services state that I have to shoe proof of having $5,000 for every dependent (totaling $15,000). Of course, I don't have that kind of money right now, but I have a graduate assistantship totaling about $26,000 per year, and I think it will be enough to support us all together.

My questions are:

1. Can I talk to my PhD advisor about whether the university can provide additional funding for my dependents? I have heard that some US universities can do that. 
2. Can my graduate assistantship make for the required proof of funding for my dependents?
3. Has anyone who was in my shoes been able to bypass that financial proof step in any way that did not require him to show financial documents of having $15,000?

t3_rn0huq,185,Tax Question Megathread 2021 Tax Submissions,2021-12-23 17:21:20,"**All Tax Questions must be posted here. All other tax posts will be removed**

[Please see last years post for more information](https://old.reddit.com/r/f1visa/comments/ljb2hk/tax_question_megathread)

&gt;Do I need to pay my 2022 taxes?

No, tax filing now is for the calendar year 2021 and begins January 2022, and ends April 15, 2022. 

&gt;I did not work in 2021, do I need to file taxes?

[You should have filed the 8843 even if you had no income.](http://blog.sprintax.com/tax-form-8843-filing-instructions) 

""There are 3 things that every US international student and J-1 visa holder needs to know about American tax:

*Every US international student and J-1 visa holder has a tax filing requirement.   
*It doesn’t matter if you have earned income. You must still file your documents before the deadline.    
*The IRS takes this stuff seriously! In other words, if you don’t comply with your tax obligations, you may encounter complications when applying for US visas in the future. "".  

&gt;Do I have to pay/file/submit taxes?

Yes, all F-1 visa holders regardless of employment or not need to file their taxes.  

If you worked in 2021 you received tax documents from your employer (likely a [W2](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-w-2) or a 1099 of some sort). You will need that form(s). You also need to file a [form 8843](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f8843.pdf). If this is you continue on to the next question.

If you did not work then you need to file a [form 8843](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f8843.pdf) That is all that you must do if you otherwise did not work or receive taxable payments.

&gt;Can I use Turbo tax or another program to file my taxes?

Yes, but you need to find out if you are a ""Resident for Tax Purposes"" or a ""Non-Resident For Tax Purposes"". You can find the questionnaire [here](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/determining-alien-tax-status)

Alternatively, you can go to [Sprintax.com](https://www.sprintax.com) sign up for their program and use the tax determination questionnaire at the beginning of their software. You do not need to pay to use this portion of their software.

If you are deemed a non-resident for tax purposes and you like their software you can continue to use it for your taxes and pay them for convenience. If you want another option there is [Glacier tax Prep](https://www.glaciertax.com) Both of these companies specialize in Non-Resident Taxes. You can also just complete the 1040NR

If you are deemed a resident for tax purposes you can use any other tax software designed for an American. Such as turbo tax, Tax Slayer, etc.

&gt;I was deemed a ""Resident for Tax Purposes"" am I now eligible for permanent resident benefits? 

Your **TAX status** is separate from your immigration status.
Your **TAX status** is informed by your immigration status.
Your **TAX status** has no impact on your immigration status.

That's why it says, ""Resident for tax purposes"". You are not an actual resident of the US and your immigration status has *not* changed. You are just now given more flexibility with your taxes and qualify for some additional tax benefits you didn't otherwise qualify for before. That said, you also have more tax liability now compared to before.

It is 100% separate from your immigration status and does not, can not, and has not granted you any sort of permanent residency in any way shape, or form.

&gt;I got a 1098-T, can I use it?

You can only use a 1098-T if you are a Resident for Tax Purposes. Otherwise, it does not apply to you.

&gt;I have Dependents on F2

You need to file your taxes based on the above and file an 8843 for each dependent.

&gt;My spouse on their own F1 needs to file

Have them follow the procedure above and file their own taxes separately.

&gt;My friend got a refund and I had to pay

That happens, there are many reasons it could happen. Taxes are VERY individual. It is possible your friend also filed using the incorrect status Resident vs. Non-Resident etc. You also could have filed wrong. If you are concerned, then use the software linked above to get an answer. If you are still confused after that contact the software provider for support.     

&gt;How do I use tax form 1099-A/M/J/L/Misc

You can use the tax software above to file your taxes or follow the instructions on the 1040-NR for non-residents or 1040/1040-EA for Residents

&gt;When do I get my refund?

If you are eligible for a refund you must submit your application as a non-resident via the mail to the IRS on/before April 15 and will receive the refund in July-October. If you elect to have it be a direct deposit, please list your valid US bank account. If you want a check, give them a mailing address where you will be later this Fall.

Residents and Non-Residents who can file electronically can receive the refund in a few business days depending on how you filed your taxes. Via the mail, it takes several weeks. If you elect to have it be a direct deposit, please list your valid US bank account. If you want a check, give them a mailing address where you will be later this summer.

I don't know where I will be in the Fall/Summer or I am leaving the U.S. this Spring/Summer!  Ask a friend you trust to use their mailing address.

&gt;Can I file my non-resident taxes online?

Yes, but e-filing can be limited by the tax filing services. 

&gt;I do not have a Social Security Number (SSN) Can I file taxes? 

Yes, but if you are not filing only the 8843 then you need an ITIN or an SSN. 

You can get an ITIN using Spritnax (for an additional fee) or via a private company using the [Acceptance Agent Program](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/acceptance-agent-program) (for a fee) or you can schedule an appointment with the IRS at one of the [IRS Taxpayer Assistance Centers](https://www.irs.gov/help/tac-locations-where-in-person-document-verification-is-provided) to both submit your taxes and the ITIN request form in person at one of their offices for free. You will need to call, schedule an appointment and bring all completed documents to the office for the submission of the ITIN request and submitting your other tax forms. If you use one of the software above as a non-resident then you can print and bring the documents from that software to their office.

&gt;How does one pay for taxes on the medical ratio refund? But if you don’t pay for insurance ex it is covered by a fellowship/scholarship then how do you account for it on your tax return?

I assume you mean the 1095 forms.

**Form 1095-A: ​**   
Healthcare coverage purchased through Health Insurance Marketplace – ‘ObamaCare’​ or the Affordable Care Act
* *Generally not applicable to international students &amp; scholars​ unless you have a special tax treaty*
* Can be used on a ‘resident’ tax return, in limited circumstances​

**Form 1095-B: ​**   
Healthcare coverage provided through an insurance provider or self-insured employer​
*You do not need 1095-B for your non-resident return​*

**Form 1095-C:​**   
Healthcare provided through an employer (generally more than 50 employees)​
*You do not need 1095-C for your non-resident return*"
t3_rnsr0n,0,The administration added some clarification on the Residence Abroad requirement for proving nonimmigrant intent,2021-12-24 19:11:43,"&gt; b. (U) The context of the residence abroad requirement for student visas inherently differs from the context for B visitor visas or other short-term visas.  The statute clearly presupposes that the natural circumstances and conditions of being a student do not disqualify that applicant from obtaining a student visa.  It is natural that the student does not possess ties of property, employment, and continuity of life typical of B visa applicants.  These ties are typically weakly held by student applicants, as the student is often single, unemployed, without property, and is at the stage in life of deciding and developing their plans for the future.  Student visa adjudication is made more complex by the fact that students typically are expected to stay in the United States longer than do many other nonimmigrant visitors, to complete their program of studies.  In these circumstances, it is important to keep in mind that the applicant’s intent is to be adjudicated based on present intent - not on contingencies of what might happen in the future, after a lengthy period of study in the United States.  Therefore, the residence abroad requirement for student applicants should be considered in the context of the usual limited ties that a student would have, and their immediate intent.
&gt; c.  (U) While students may not be able to demonstrate the same strong ""ties,"" present in other classes of applicants, their typical youth often conveys a countervailing major advantage in establishing their bona fides: they are not expected to, or do not necessarily have a long-range plan, and may legitimately not be able to fully explain their plans at the conclusion of their studies.  As most students are relatively young and many reside with parents or guardians, you can consider a student to be maintaining a residence abroad if he or she intends to return to reside with parents or guardians.  Nonetheless, you must be satisfied at the time of application for a visa that the visa applicant possesses the present intent to depart the United States at the conclusion of his or her approved activities.  That this intention is subject to change or even likely to change is not a sufficient reason to deny a visa.  Further, the present intent to depart, does not infer the need to return to the country from which they hold a passport.  It means only that they must intend to leave the United States upon completion of studies.

This was added on 12/20/2021. See 9 FAM 402.5-5(E)(1)  (U) Residence Abroad Required:

t3_rpzgoh,7,F-1 Visa Renewal Denied While on OPT,2021-12-27 22:41:28,"I completed both my Bachelors and Masters in the US and stated working in April of this year. Unfortunately, my father passed away in October of this year and so I had to return home to Nigeria for his funeral. 

Before doing this I hade to make sure everything was in order so I waited till I received my OPT extension card which begins in Jan 2022, and I made a visa appointment for Dec 14th. After securing all of this I was confident that I could go back, attend the funeral, and return to my job in the US. 

At my appointment I was denied because I did not show intention of returning to my home country and this was due to lack of proper preparation. Now I am scrambling to get another date. In the system it asks if I have been denied a US visa before and when I say ""Yes"" no dates pop up, but when I select ""No"" a lot of dates are showing up for even January. 

I have not informed my employer yet, because I haven't worked for them for up to a year and I am scared that they will likely terminate my employment. But I don't know if they would be able to maybe write an appeal for me or somehow help matters.

I would really appreciate any advice you can give me in this situation, all my things are in the US; my car, apartment and important documents. what do I do??"
t3_rqso1k,8,F1 Visa refused under 221g,2021-12-28 23:18:53,"My brother who has been travelling to the USA on B1/B2 Visa with highest stay of 2 months was issued 221g for F1 Visa to study Ph.D program in education. 
He has always been placed on Administrative processing .The first was 9 months, then 2mosnths in that pattern but subsequently  issued. This one has gone 6 months no update. 
He has deferred from Fall to Spring 2022 but the program will start in three weeks.  No updates.  He was told to provide two years of pre paid tuition which is not normal.  The school has written the Embassy to let them  know that international students pay only when they get visa not when they haven't.  They also said that the i20 is not the guarantee of a visa therefore they are not required to pay tuition in advance. 

A lot of retired Visa officers have said this is not normal once he provided proof of funds more than that amount on the i20. 
It is now over 180 days.  
Any experience or advice.  
Note: the first trip on B1/B2 was under 221g for 270 days  or 9 months before Visa was issued.

I want to ask whether all uni require language competency ( i.e. IELTS ) certificate ? I saw an ads for master program that no need for it, could it be scam ?

Another thing I want to confirm, can I get F1 Visa for study english ( in order to pass IELTS exam ) in USA? fyi, I don't have confidence and very anxious person, so when interviewed, my mind gone blank and I couldn't say the english word that I need to say ( my country is not english speaking country ). So, I'm thinking, if IELTS is needed in order to get master degree, can I take english lesson in USA ( because in USA english will be used in daily, meanwhile in my home country, it rarely used, and some people love to mocking people that trying to learn here ) .

Also, I'm afraid that the embassy officer will deny my student visa if I say I'm planning to take english ( full time ) to pass IELTS and then take master after acquired my IELTS certificate .

I tried english course in my home country, even paid for private tutor, but only got discouraged to learn. So, that's why I'm considering english language program first in USA ( offline &amp; full time program ). Online learning is not my type since I easily distracted in home.

TLDR: 

considering taking fulltime offline english language program in USA, can advice me how to get visa  ? after english language program done &amp; got my IELTS certificate,I'm planning to enroll into master program ( computer science, and preferably at west coast )

t3_s37dqb,3,F2 still valid while applying for F1?,2022-01-13 19:24:54,"I am a PhD student on a F1 visa, with my spouse on a F2 visa. Recently, my spouse also got admitted to a PhD program for Spring 2022 and went back to our home country to apply for a F1 visa rather than changing status while still in the US. Their application was put into administrative processing in late Nov.

The school has said students can only enroll by 21th Jan so seeing as there is no response to the application as of yet (and presumably they will not be able to enroll for spring 2022), my spouse now wishes to come back to the US to be together again while the processing goes on or until a decision is reached. 

Would their F2 visa still be valid? Is there any way of knowing whether the F2 visa was canceled or not when my spouse applied for F1 visa?

We plan to return to our home country for summer holidays. So in case my spouse comes back to the US and is granted the F1 visa, will we able to go in the summer and get it stamped then or will the visa be canceled if my spouse is not there to receive the visa immediately?

Alternatively, if they do stay and wait for the F1 visa, would they be able to travel back to the US on the F2 and then switch over to F1 when re-entering after summer? Or will the F2 get canceled and the 'enter only 30 days before start of program' then start to apply? 

Is there any way where we don't have to spend so much time apart?"

I was born in Cuba, but I moved to Mexico to complete my Master degree and now I'm enrolled in a prestigious PhD program in Mexico. I have 2 weeks free in february and I enrolled in an intensive English course in EF International, campus Miami Beach (2 weeks duration). I consider it as a great opportunity to enhance my communication skills and also some sort of productive vacation, since I recently ended my Master degree and I was kinda burn out.

I had everything ready for my consular interview, got all my admission documents, bank statement, my renewed residence, proof of studies, proof of my family living here in Mexico, literally everything.

However the consul only focused in the fact I'm a Biotechnology PhD student and I studied Biotechnology in my Master. No further questions, they sent me straight to administrative process and a full list of documents to send via email

They requested all my phone numbers I used 2 years ago in Cuba, everything I did in Cuba ( even tho I don't visit my country since I started the MD), my family numbers, names, jobs. And the most important: an entire list of every research conducted in Cuba and in Mexico, and my full CV and supervisors.

The consul said: there's a problem with you being cuban and biotechnology student, we need more documentation about you.

I sent all the information requested but I felt so bad because I was being judged because of my nationality when it's something I can't change and also my research area, like if I could be some sort of terrorist or something. 

Is there anyone with similar experience or do anyone know how long can this administrative process be?

I applied for my initial OPT on 07/21/2021. It took them 90 days to tell me they need more documents (address history, employment history, transcripts, grades, tuition payments receipts, other unnecessary stuff). 

I responded to the RFE on 11/02/2021. They were suppose to respond within 60 days. By 60 days no response!

I called their custom care on 01/03/2022. They created a service request and told me to expect to hear from them in 30 days. It’s been 20 days since then and nothing. 

I have placed a request with Ombudsman, and it will take them 2-3 months to respond.

t3_sadjfw,10,Can I shorten I-20 Program End date after OPT approval? The degree was conferred earlier than expected.,2022-01-22 22:11:33,"Hello,

I am a graduate student with a thesis/dissertation in my degree. The original I20 End date was in May 2022. Since I was able to finish my degree earlier, when I filed an application to USCIS for OPT, my DSO shortened my I20 End date to January 2022 since the presentation of my thesis/dissertation was scheduled for December 2021 and we estimated that I would be able to upload the thesis/dissertation by January 2022. Based on that, I picked my EAD start date in February 2022.

However, I was able to both present and upload my thesis/dissertation in December 2021. As a result, I received my degree and my degree conferral date is stated as December 2021 (specifically it is stated as the last day of the Fall semester). However, the I-20 that I used in order to get my OPT and my EAD has an End Date on January 2022. 

Therefore, the I20 I used in order to get my EAD has an End date which is 1 month later than the degree conferral date.

1) Is this an issue for now? If yes, what should I do?

2) If I don't have to do something now, could this be an issue in the future? 

Note: The Feb start date stated in my EAD is still within the 60-day grace period even in the case where someone would consider December as End date."

So when I first apply for US visa, I enter Given Name as Middle Name - First Name (I didnot know about US name format atm).  

For form I-94, they use my Middle Name as my First Name right now which can cause a lot of issue when I apply for OPT. 

I can not change I-94 name because CBP already told me they will go with the name other I have on my US visa which mean Middle Name - First Name format.

But my I-20 form currently have my name in the correct order.

The fact that this 2 forms showing different name will most likely result in RFE when I apply for OPT.

I was hoping to visit my home country in the summer or the fall. Here are some of my questions and concerns:

- If I have a pending STEM OPT extension application BUT my EAD card for my original non-STEM OPT is still unexpired, would I be able to travel during that time? Or would they consider my OPT extension application to be “abandoned” if I leave the country?

- If I travel after my STEM extension has been approved, would I be able to renew my visa or does this usually carry a high risk?

- My company says they are able to sponsor H1B visas. If I apply for the lottery this March and I’m rejected, will that lottery application be considered “intent to immigrate” and prevent me from getting an F1 renewal (or a new F1 in the future for a different degree program)? 

I do plan on returning to my home country eventually, after gaining some work experience in the US. My whole family lives in my home country, I have money and property there (not a lot but more than I have in the US), and my relative owns a small business that I want to help out with.

To summarize, I will be only missing 1 day of classes (March 14th). Should I expect any issues? I will have official calendar, schedule etc printed out to prove everything

&amp;#x200B;

I am worried because I did something similar for winter break (our winter break was \~5-6 weeks but I was home for \~8 weeks). However, again, my classes had only projects and no finals, so I basically had no lectures left and did not miss anything when I left before the official winter break, which starts after the finals' weeks. Granted, I was not asked anything when arrived back, but maybe this ""repeated pattern"" might be a problem with CBP"

It's a salaried position but it's for 20 hours per week and considered part-time by the university.

Fedex claims to have delivered it, as soon as she got the notification it was delivered she went to grab it and it wasn't there. Fedex is being extremely unhelpful and the embassy isn't being super helpful either.

I believe her original passport contained her visa wich she needs to continue staying in the states. I'm a little murky on the details but i think she was applying to extend/renew her visa.

She has been told if she cannot get ahold of her original visa/passport she will have to apply in person for a new one in her country of origin. This will completely fuck her over, she has a job, an appartment, a dog. She is currently working as a research assistant and working towards her phd.

I was wondering **if it'd be possible for me to apply for STEM extension based on the job offer alone, even though I'll be unemployed at the time of applying?**

If the answer is yes, then I have a follow up question.

When my OPT ends, I'll be unemployed with only 10 unemployment days left from the 90 days available during OPT . Since the job starts 30 days after OPT period ends, my unemployment days will be exhausted 20 days before I can start at the new job.

I understand that STEM extension grants 60 days of unemployment during the 24-month extension period.  My question is: **Can I avail these 60 days of unemployment while a decision is pending on my OPT STEM extension application?** Or are these 60 days only available once the extension has been approved?

t3_t5zcoc,0,Day 1 CPT for new international student?,2022-03-03 19:19:58,"Hey, fellow members of the f1 visa community. I wanted your opinion on this profession hybrid program that I received an admit from.
It's MS Data Science (Professional Hybrid) from a Saint Peter's University, NJ. It's a professional hybrid program so we are required to undertake some sort of internship/employment to complete the masters (sort of like Day 1 CPT).

Classes are held every weekend on-campus, and online during the week days. We're supposed to take 3 credit online, and 3 credits on-campus per trimester.

The university also offers a regular MS Data Science. But I chose this course, so that I can gain some experience on the side (University also has ties/provides good projects to work on in industry according to some alumni). Most to the alumni of this hybrid course were new international students, and are currently working in good jobs.

So, would it be a good step for me to choose this program? Because as far as I can see it seems like a good option to me.

But what I'm concerned about is the fact that if I land to job let's say maybe in the first 3-4 months, I'll be on CPT very early (though it's a program requirement). Let's say I work there for 11 months (for future OPT situation), and then get on part-time CPT for the rest of the masters. 

All of this would be legal. But would I face any problem during the whole OPT and maybe in the future H1B process, due to the fact that I was on CPT just 3-4 months into my masters, and worked all through my masters on CPT (full-time + part-time)?"

t3_tcsdw8,2,F1 to H1B to back to F1,2022-03-12 22:21:59,"Hi f1visa community,

Background:

I  am currently on a STEM OPT working in a big tech company (the usual shebang). My STEM OPT expires this year in July 2022. My F1 visa expired last year (2021) and I haven't traveled outside the US since then. My company applied for my H1B, decisions to which are supposed to come out by the end of March.

Complication:

This year I also applied to graduate schools (Ph.D. programs) and got accepted to one. I am planning to accept that offer by early April.

Now I see 2 scenarios here:

1. I  don't get H1B and there are no further complications. It will just be like getting a new I-20 and going back home to extend my F1.
2. I  get selected for the H1B - Now in this case the company lawyers told me  that it can take a few months (up to October) to process H1Bs

Questions:

In scenario 2:

1. Does anyone know how will this complicate things for me? Will I be able to revert back to F1  while my H1B is still processing? How does this usually work? Do I lose my H1B as soon as the university starts my F1 process, or does the H1B  go on hold? (tbh I don't care much about H1B as long as can I safely  start my Ph.D. on time)
2. Would I be able to travel in the middle of this clusterf\*\*k or should I stay in the US until I have my I-20 in hand?

I  don't wanna take this to the company lawyers yet because I haven't officially gotten and accepted the grad school offer yet. They told me it takes around 12-15 business days to process it especially because it's the busiest time of the year.

As always I appreciate any help. Thanks..."

I am a participant on STEM OPT. My last employment ended on December 3rd, 2021, and I have been in the job market since.

Recently, I received a notification from my school, stating that I may need to report employment information and that I may have exceeded the number of unemployment days.

However, I do not believe that this is the case. It has been approximately 105 days since December 3rd, and during my Post-Completion OPT, I had accrueed approximately 11 days of unemployment(between 05/21/2020 and 06/01/2020).

Taken together, these are 116 days of unemployment, meaning that I should still have 34 days left.

This is all information that I can see is in my SEVP Portal, and also in my previous i20s. I had also made sure to submit my final evaluation after ending employment with my previous employer.

So I am not sure as to why I received this notification. The wording was that ""you may have exceeded"" so I am wondering if this is just the wording of their automatic email process.

I have reached out to my school about this, but the next drop-in hours for advising are on Monday, so I worry that my mind may be occupied by this through the weekend. I have two interviews happening on Monday, and I am planning to attend GDC from Tuesday onwards, for which I would need to also prepare.

The first day I can apply is in early April, but I may be moving around late June because my lease is expiring and I’m not sure if I’ll be able to stay in my current apartment.

However, in case it’s still processing by the end of June and I have to move, I’m thinking of either getting a PO box and using that as my mailing address when I apply, or using the change of address form to update it to my new address or to a PO box address when I move.

Has the change of address form worked for people who applied online &amp; moved addresses? I’ve heard some unfortunate stories about the form not being processed on time &amp; EAD cards being lost / misdelivered, so I’m a bit worried. 

I’ve also seen that PO boxes are allowed, but I’m not sure if they’re reliable - a lot of different schools’ international offices seem to have mixed opinions on using a PO box as your mailing address (some recommend it, some say it’s not recommended, some say it’s fully not allowed.. which seems incorrect but I’m not sure) so I would love some advice from someone who has either used the address change form OR had their EAD card mailed to a PO box address.

1. I will have to use AVR multiple times i.e. do multiple 30 day trips to Canada. Is that okay? Has people done this before?  
2. AVR is only valid for business/leisure travel. Since, **my visit to University of Alberta will not require a work visa permit** (under Global Skills Strategy), would my visit considered a business/leisure trip?

I finished my Master's in US in 2019, and abut to complete my STEM OPT in June 2022. I got accepted into a PhD program, and the program will start in fall (September, 2022). I wanted to go back to India after my STEM opt ends and come back before the program begins in September, since I have not gone back since I came to the US in 2017. My F-1 visa is also expiring in june, and I plan to renew it while in india.

My question is - since I have not gone back to india since coming to the US, will this pose a problem when I give my visa interview? I am not qualified for dropbox, since I will start my PhD in a different university. I have strong family ties, since I am the only child in my whole family (both my uncles don't have children), and my family has a few properties in India as well. My PhD will be fully funded, and my family can support me as well if need be. I am just paranoid about this 5 year gap in not going back to india since I came here.

Another question is - If I choose to not go back to india now, can I continue staying in the US from June to September? My STEm OPT ends on June 08, and PhD begins on September 1. I am planning to transfer my SEVIS record to my new university on June 08.

I will be continuing my studies in the US, and till now worked on STEM OPT. I gained admission into PhD program, and will be attending that from september. My F-1 visa is about to expire, and since I haven't visited my parents in a while, was planning to return home, and also renew my F-1 visa.

However, I had submitted my 12 month STEM OPT validation report about a month after the due date, and my DSO said she could not submit that to the SEVIS now, since its past due, but she has records of me submitting it to the school in the school's records. I have not missed any other validation reporting deadlines. I can still access my SEVP portal, and it says my STEM OPT is still active on the portal. It also says that my 12 month validation report is past due.

My question is, could this be an issue during the F-1 visa interview? (I do not qualify for the interview waiver since I will be changing schools)."

I was doing a Masters from 2016 - 2018 on an F1 visa in the US. I had completed all my degree requirements by May 2018, but I wanted to do a Thesis and so requested an extension to my I20 on the last day of the semester. The DSO couldn't update the I20 since it was already too late, and because of my negligence on this matter, I continued pursuing my thesis and intended to graduate over the summer (I totally forgot to keep my DSO and my Graduate Program Director updated and didn't actively follow up with them). However, a couple of months later I realized that my SEVIS had been terminated since my 60 day grace period was over. The records showed that I had already finished all requirements for the degree. I couldn't request for OPT and after talking to the DSO and realizing that it will be a futile effort, I decided to come back to my home country after 10 days of my grace period expiry. (I returned on 28th July 2018, my grace period expired on 18th July 2018). Subsequently, I was awarded a passing grade on my Thesis.   


I have received a PhD offer from a different university in the US and if things go well, I am expected to join the university this fall (fall 2022). I have paid the SEVIS fee and I am about to start looking for interview slots. I will possibly not be eligible for interview waiver.

I am currently on STEM OPT, and have set the Transfer Release Date to be 1 day before my last unemployment day(am currently unemployed and have until roughly April 21st days of unemplioyment remaining).

However, my program does not start until September. The date is a bit unknown at the moment, but what I am curious about is what happens on the Transfer Release Date.

My University's academic calendar has classes starting from September 19th. Now, that is slightly less than 5 months from April 20th, but it is more than 150 days.

My question is - when they say that my classes need to start within 5 months of transfer release date, do they mean 150 days or like 5 actual months?

Now, I have already had my Transfer-Out approved by my DSO, who has set April 20th as the Transfer Release date ( I submitted September 19th as the start date on the form). I worry that on the 20th, if it is indeed 150 days and not 5 months, then the transfer may get denied."

Due to an emergency I had to travel to the UK and my F1 visa was expired since 2020. It was a really stressful time as many people were saying that renewing F1 visa on OPT is super risky. To complicate things further my employer also would not grant remote work authorization for more than a month. I am a Pakistani national so that also made things more uncertain as a TCN

After filling out DS 160 and submitting visa fees on 27th January, got first appointment for 1st March at London embassy. Checked everyday and got a sooner appointment on Feb 2nd.

Day of Appointment:

Brought everything I could think of including EAD card, verification of employment, paystubs etc. The processor only asked for passport and I20s and photos. The consular then asked what was the degree plan. Informed him that my degree was already finished and he seemed very surprised. He then just asked what field I worked in. He then informed that my application is going under administrative processing and gave me a white slip. They also returned our passports.

The document said that I had to provide 15 years travel History, all issued passport numbers and 5 year old social media Ids, 5 year old employment history.
I got a separate email from the embassy the next day asking for employment letter, invitation letter and a detailed CV. Provided everything by Feb 5th.

Request for Passports:

Got an email requesting Passports back on 9th March. I was unfortunately traveling to my home country so I had to wait until I came back to submit passport. Email said I had 4 months to submit. Submitted my Passports on 31st March and status changed to Issued on 5th of April.

I wanted to go back to india in June, since I haven't been back to india for 5 years. I also need to get my F-1 visa renewed. I was able to get an appointment to drop off the documents, , since I qualify for the interview waiver. But I am afraid that in the small chance that I get called for an in-person interview, it might take months for me to actually get an interview date, seeing how crazy hard it is to get these appointments now.

My other option is to wait for another year, and hopefully it'll be easier to get appointments in 2023. Do you think its worth the risk to go back this year, given how hard it is to get in-person interviews, if I do get called for one?

I'm also worried that it'll be 6 years since I've gone back to India, if I choose to go back next year. Will that cause an issue with potential immigrant intent?

I'm really hoping to hear your opinions, since I'm freaking out and losing sleep over this decision that I need to make!

So I've been looking around for this detail and came across alot of people saying that we need to show 1.5x the amount of i20, some are saying 2x of i20. 
Can anyone actually clarify how much amount are we actually required to show for Visa for let's say two year course. 
Is it 
a) i20 (plus some 5000$ to be safe) 
b) 1.5 x i20
c) 2 x i20

I’m a resident here; pay taxes etc, have legal work permit, I have a valid legal status that’s beyond the 12 months and will allow me to come back. My employer will also provide a letter stating I’ve been granted leave to pursue my masters and upon completion, I have a role waiting for me.

As supporting documents, I’ll add in my tax slip, payslips, proof of employment, leave of absence for studies. Will that be enough to show strong connection to my country of residence?

1. I studied for 4 years doing Computer Science Engineering. This was a government college in India and got it through my merit. However, allegations leading to corruption in the university were rampant. I used to write the exam for 80-90 but still used to be given a fail. The scam was to make money by asking students to apply for a re-check. This affected my mental health, I cleared all my exams at the end of 4 years but University started cracking down and asked around 3k students at that time to re-write all our exams!
2. I was good at my skills and got immediate jobs in leading startups. I have worked in 4 companies and I manage 20 Engineers now. I have 5-6 years of backend and frontend, product building, and scaling experience.
3. I started doing a distance degree from the University of London, and I have finished 2.5 years with 86 percent. I only have one more semester to go!

What are my prospects of getting into a University, and how difficult will it be to explain to the Visa officers?

I contacted my DSO to update my CPT I-20 but said SEVIS wouldn't allow them to make changes and there's nothing they can do about it and I'd have to remain ""full-time"" status on my current I-20.  
Keep in mind that this DSO had been giving me problems rather than assisting me. They've stated that everything is under the student's responsibility (I guess this includes incorrect immigration document filing/information). Not being able to go in office in-person and sending emails are just making things hard because the International center staff are all woking remotely. The DSO wouldn't reply till end of day or even few days later.

The interview lasted about 2 mins and the consular officer told me that my visa had been approved. She even gave me the yellow slip but she told me that they legally couldn't issue my visa until 4 months prior to my program start date. My program starts on the 14th of August.

t3_u3mcvt,7,F1 renewal on STEM OPT worth it?,2022-04-14 17:11:13,"I am currently on my STEM OPT extension, which expires in May 2023. However, my visa expires in July 2022. I am trying to evaluate the risk of applying for an F1 visa but I am really nervous about my current F1 visa becoming void or canceled should I go down that route, let alone the new visa application being denied. 

I have a pretty solid job I enjoy and I would hate to lose out on a whole year of it should my application be denied and my current visa canceled alongside. I am mainly concerned about this happening as there would only be about a year or less left on my STEM extension should I choose to apply for a new F1 visa. What is the probability of this occurring? Am I better off just not applying for a new visa?

On the other hand, I would also hate to have an expired visa should I have to experience emergency travel, which would make applying for a new visa even harder after its expiry. 

I also am unsure if I should travel to my home country where I am not a resident but have the strongest ties to, or whether I should go to Mexico City since it is common for international students to apply for visas from there. My home country is where I have applied and been issued all of my previous US visas. This would be my third F1 application as I have earned one bachelors and two masters degrees thus far.

I would really appreciate hearing of similar experiences any of you might have, or any advice in general!"

So can I still somehow complete the co-op? My friend told me I would be getting 12 credits from the university but I am not sure since the IPO rejected my application. Some people are telling me it depends on the university and F1 visa holders can do a co-op. Thoughts? Thank you."

I am in a somewhat unusual situation and will appreciate your advice. I am from India and I completed a PhD in English in the US on an F-1 visa (and renewed it once during the course of my degree). After that I did one year OPT, and am now doing an MFA in creative writing (due to change in career path). My visa is due for renewal this year so I can finish the final year of my MFA. But other Indian students tell me there is a high chance my renewal application will be rejected as my current degree (Master of Fine Arts) is lower than my previous PhD degree, which is the highest level. I am advised to stay here and complete my degree on the strength of my I-20 status.

I will appreciate your advice here. Would there be an addition risk (on top of the usual visa risk) to renew for a lower level degree than your previous one? If I stay on an expired visa, I know i can't travel outside the country, but how might it also affect future visa renewals/job visa applications/OPT? 

Also, I qualify for visa interview waiver; is it worth taking the risk and returning to India to renew my visa? Does anyone know long long visa apps are taking in India/Delhi these days due to the backlog? Thanks for your help everyone!"

I am kind of stressed about my upcoming f1 visa interview as my last couple visa appointments were denied withoout looking at document or nothing, which kind of discouraged me. In 2019 i travelled twice to California on a VWP as i'm a french national, both trips were roughly 80\~ days (never overstayed, or worked, or did anything illegal, just travelled around california, \[SF, san diego, coachella) and went back to the UK on december of 2019. A couple of months later in 2020 not knowing covid was going to happen, I had applied for a B2 at the US Embassy in London (where i resided at the time). It was immediately denied and I think it was because I had someone in the US that vouched to pay all my expenses and where I would stay etc... So after that appointment being refused I was really discouraged and demotivated. So at this point I thought the main reason for my denial was having a US sponsor and perhaps the recent 80 day trips. Fast forward to August of 2021 and I decided to try my luck at a f1 visa in a differrent embassy in my homecountry of Algeria, and me the stupid fuck that I am, applied with the same sponsor. It was denied and documents weren't even looked at even though I had that sponsor's written letter and his bank statements clearly stating that I was going there to pursue my studies and would clearly be back once my studies were at an end, all justified paperwork.

I have my next interview in 15 days time and am applying with my mother as my sponsor, took me a year to raise the funds and I hope this time I can get my visa accepted. Any tips or suggestions, or things I should raise to the visa officer in regards to my past interviews?

I am a F1 student currently finishing my OPT and concurrently getting ready to move abroad once again, however my deadline is pretty tight and it seems as though my visa processes for my move will have to happen here, during my Grace period. 

My visa stamp expired a year or two back, my I-20 doesn’t mention the whole 60 days grace period thing so how do I prove that I am lawfully here ? They need proof of legal status. Knowing that it’s a requirement for the application. 

Maybe an odd question but if anyone has any idea please… it would be very helpful

t3_u984oy,0,F-1 Visa Renewal (India),2022-04-22 06:36:16,"Hey everyone! I am looking to renew my F-1 visa for beginning my PhD in late September, was hoping to get an Interview Waiver drop-opp appointment sometime in June. Have had no luck so far, but had a few questions -

1. Is there a group chat where people post updates about visa slots? 

2. I got locked out for checking too frequently; does the lock out last the entirety of 72 hours? I read 24 hours somewhere, but wanted to ask.

2. Is there a difference in the slots for regular interviews/ interview waivers?

3. Can I look for appointments in places other than the post assigned to me by default based on my state of residence? I got Kolkata, but when I tried to look at Delhi I was just transported back to the beginning of my application. I don't mind travelling to anywhere, but I don't think miscommunicating my state of residence to get another post is appropriate.

Any thoughts on any of these questions would be greatly appreciated. Feel free to get in touch to figure this out together! Thank you and have a nice day!"

They had said it would take about 2-3 weeks for them to give back the I-20, and I was surprised because a couple of my friends said they will get theirs in a matter of 4-5 days at most. When I asked the admissions person about this inordinate delay, I was told this was because they had more international students, and close to 2000 Indian students. Today, I texted them again to check up, and turns out they haven't started on my application yet because I haven't submitted my passport, although I had submitted it in their portal and the portal confirmed that I had. When I informed them of this technical glitch, they told me to email them directly, and told me it would take 2-4 weeks now. 

I'm really puzzled by this huge delay, and now the US consulate is saying it will add slots in Mid May for appointments beginning on June 1. My question is this - if I don't get a slot in June or July, what are the chances of my securing an expedited appointment (provided I even qualify for that)? Secondly, if I manage to convince my program head that reaching in Sept/Oct (rather than August) is okay, can I relax and afford to book a slot on a later date and go? Most importantly, what are the chances that I will be turned down by my university if I don't manage to get Visa by a certain date?

Although I'm not planning to apply for another F-1 until August, I want to get out ahead of this. Of course I intend to leave the US when my status ends, but how specifically do consular officials expect me to demonstrate this? And how substantial is the risk, really? I'm not really old enough or wealthy enough to have meaningful assets here or back home, although obviously I have significant family ties.

t3_ud61pc,3,Completely clueless with the dropbox method,2022-04-27 15:20:33,"**Extra Context:** 

1. I was issued a visa as a minor which expired in 2018
2. Where I applied(Hyderabad) biometrics are taken in another building, not the consulate. 

**Context:**

I had my ofc appointment on 25th(I don't have a date for the interview because CGI federal did not show me a page where I could do that. It went from MRV payment to ofc and that was it).

Anyways, on the 25th I was asked to take a token, stand in a line and when my turn came I was asked to present my: 

1. passport
2. i-20
3. DS-160 confirmation
4. visa slot confirmation( on which he stamped the date '25 APRIL' and returned it to me) 

I was then told to leave. I asked him if I should present him with any more documents he said no and told me to leave again. 

I asked if there was an interview he said no. I asked if I had to put any more documents in an envelope/file and drop them in the dropbox at the consulate. He said I didn't have to do anything else, I just had to revisit and collect the passport. I went to the consulate officials, stated my case, and asked if there was anything else that had to be done they said I just had to collect my passport after 2-3 days when I get a mail/message. 

That's it. No more questions no more documents. I know this wasn't an interview at the consulate but I feel strongly that the process is missing a lot of things. The officials in the VISA office(biometrics)/ consulate were of no help, USTraveldocs responses are as good as a chatbot so I'm turning to Reddit.

**Issue:**

I was asked to wait for a mail but I did not receive a mail when I paid the MRV and SEVIS fee which were huge payments. I did not receive a mail confirming visa slot booking. The only mail I ever got was informing me about how I could get the passport couriered to my house for the 'nominal price of 650 rupees', so I can't just wait for the mail to come. 

VISA office is also very far away so I can't go and ask if I can collect my passport personally on a daily basis. I can only manage 2-3 times a week.

I am very confused because

1. My biometrics were not taken.
2. My SEVIS and MRV payment receipts were not asked
3. My photo ID(aadhar card\[unique Indian ID\]) was not asked
4. My financial documents were not asked
5. My visa was processed in the dropbox method as mentioned by the VISA office staff but I did not drop my documents in any 'dropbox'.

**Questions:**

1. Why were biometrics not taken on the OFC appointment, which is meant for biometrics?
2. Why was I not asked to drop my documents in a dropbox(even though there was a literal dropbox at the consulate that some H1/F1 applicants used to drop off their documents\[ in a file\] in front of my own eyes)? 
3. Why were my SEVIS, MRV and financial documents not asked?
4. How do I know if my VISA was granted?

**Request:**

If anybody had similar issues and knows the answers to any of my questions kindly reply.

If you have the same issues as me and are equally confused please mail UStraveldocs. I know it's pointless but if enough people ask maybe there is a chance that any of our questions get featured in the FAQ section.

t3_udpqwc,3,Can a visa be cancelled for &gt;5 months leave of absence,2022-04-28 07:48:04,"Hi,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a master's student from India currently on a leave of absence. I left the U.S on Dec 30th 2021 and plan to go back in June. This would make my leave of absence duration &gt; 5months. I am concerned about my return to the U.S with a new SEVIS ID on the old F1 visa. My embassy, following Dept. of State guidelines, says that after 5 months outside the U.S my visa is no longer valid. CBP, under Dept. Of Homeland Security, just says that the visa needs to be valid (which it is). My university advisor says that people usually do not have an issue in a case like mine, but it's better to make sure that my visa has not been cancelled or revoked. Now, my question is as follows:  


Can my embassy cancel/revoke my visa after 5 months outside the U.S i.e after  May 31st simply because of the '5 months rule'? (I don't have any kind of violation that can lead to a cancellation otherwise)"

t3_ui4qjr,48,F1 Visa with Interview Waiver Experience in India,2022-05-04 11:49:24,"I think I was among the first ones to apply for a F1 visa with an interview waiver this year. I struggled to find any resources like interview experiences or anyone to clear some doubts I had about the process, especially about financial documents. I went to the dropbox appointment with all these questions still unanswered, but luckily it was a very straightforward process so there were no glitches.

If you qualify for an interview waiver (mentioned how to check eligibility at the bottom of the post), these are the documents that you need to carry with you:

1. Passport with old US Visa
2. 2 US VISA compliant passport size pictures
3. i20
4. Appointment Letter
5. DS160

NO FINANCIAL DOCUMENTS WERE ASKED.

I carried the SEVIS Fee receipt with me but I was not asked to submit this document. I asked twice if it was required but I got a straight ‘NO’.

So that was it on the documents front. Now to the experience:

I had my document drop-off scheduled at 10:15 AM at Hyderabad VAC. It’s located right next to the Rasoolpura Metro Station. Outside the OFC you have a lot of facilities like printing shops, lockers, restaurant, photo studio etc. For the document drop-off here you need to make sure you are not carrying any electronic items with you. Usually you will have one or the other gadgets like mobile phone, smartwatch etc with you. So just use the locker facility. I don’t remember how much they charge but it was nominal (100-200 only). It’s worth the pain of not having to travel to the VAC without your phone.

Show your appointment letter at the entrance, stand in line, enter the facility, submit the documents, exit the facility with a stamp on the appointment letter. DONE.

After almost 7-8 business days, I received a mail that my passport was ready for pick-up. I had given the Chennai location as my passport pickup point. This particular point is NOT the American Embassy in Chennai. It’s an VAC in Chennai. Take a copy of your Indian Govt ID (Aadhaar or Driving Licence) and wait in queue. Collect your passport when your turn comes. DONE.

NOTE: there is no restriction on electronic gadgets when you go to collect your passport from the Chennai VAC. At max the security personnel will ask you to switch off your devices. There are many facilities like locker, printing and photo studio near the VAC.

1. Will putting that work experience cause a disadvantage in getting the visa? 
2. If I have to mention it, should I mention it in the previous work experience or present as I’m not sure when is my visa appointment and I want to fill it beforehand in May? 
3. Or should I not mention about the work experience at all?

I’m from one of SEA countries, and the visa process is stricter than usual because of current political situations. So, I’m getting anxious making mistake even for the smallest detail. I don’t want to ruin my chance since it is hard even to get the visa appointments.

Idk when to check the slots and what’s the guarantee that I’ll get the slot at a random login time which will also exhaust one login out of three per day. 

The telegram group that I’m in is chaotic. There’s a message every minute saying no slots. And if there is one, they say it’s a scam and don’t waste login. How else can I book a slot correctly without getting my account frozen? Is there a genuine group giving accurate info? 

Please help I’m panicking everytime I get a new message from the telegram group. TIA!"

t3_ujt6lr,8,"Fraud IT Consultant Company, Any advice?",2022-05-06 17:54:05,"I am a recent graduate on OPT. During my search for a job I was contacted by this IT consultant company. The job offer was that I would work as an unpaid intern, training to learn a new skillset for about 6 weeks, then they would update my resume with all the new skills that I learned and send it out to their clients afterwards. If for some reason I left the company I would have to pay for the training which was about $10,000. This seemed like an okay deal because I didn't intend on quitting and it sounded good for my OPT because they said they would also sponsor my H1B visa. 

After the training was done and they wanted to begin marketing me to their clients they produced a completely fake resume. This resume had nothing on it from me except my actual name. They gave me 7+ years of false experience and listed multiple companies that I 'worked at' when I never even heard of these places. 

This felt very unethical and deceitful to me so I did not want to move forward with it. The time I spent as an unpaid intern for this company I could have spent looking for an actual job. I am also wondering about the $10,000 training fee that they said that I would have to pay. If I knew from the beginning that they would have falsified a resume I would never have agreed to it. Additionally how would this affect my OPT? when I leave this company I would have 50 days to find an actual job right?"

t3_ujzzl7,4,F-1 Visa Renewal on OPT while waiting for EAD,2022-05-06 23:15:04,"Hi guys,

I know that going back to your home country while on OPT is very risky as the Embassy can totally deny your visa. Is there anyone here that have successfully renewed your visa while on OPT? Did you do it by mail or did you get called for an interview? Any tips? I appreciate any inputs :)

I haven't been back to my home country (Vietnam) for a very long time and would like to go back this June 2022. My last date of class will be 7/30/22 and I just applied for an OPT that starts 9/28/22. I also have a job offer already.

If I do go back to Vietnam, I will be traveling without the EAD possession (my friend will bring it back to VN for me whenever the EAD card arrives). I will apply for visa renewal as soon as I'm in VN. My questions are:

1) Will I be able to request a visa renewal with just the I-797 receipt notice and not the EAD? I understand that I will need the physical EAD card to enter the U.S.

2) Should I include my job offer for the visa renewal? I want to use this as proof that I will have a job to return to, but at the same time I'm afraid it will backfire on me as the Embassy could think that I have no intention of going back home? 

3) I plan to go back to the US at the end of August 2022. With a valid passport, valid visa stamp, valid EAD, but an I-20 that ends 7/30/22, will there be any problems at the airport?

Lastly, small side note: given how this whole thing could vary by country, any input from Viet folks would be a bonus star for this situation.

I'm very stressed and anxious about this situation :( Any advices/ thoughts on this will help! Thank you all in advance :)"

My questions: 
- Am I allow to work in my current company with the title staff accountant while taking master classes with a major in information system? 

My current employer didn't apply for h1b this year because I don't have CPA license and they urge me to pursue master and take CPA. The thing is i'm underpaid now and I don't want to waste money for master if they ended up not apply for h1b 

Q: out of curiosity if I ended up not taking my master, can my employer apply for h1b next year 2023? My opt ends feb 2023. 

What should I do in my current situation? I do not want to return to my home country because the salary is nothing compare to the US. 

I have canada in mind but it will be challenging considering I don't have enough credit for PR. I tried to networking with people in Canada but the first thing they ask is am I authorized to work in canada where I don't have the autorization.

My question: what documents should I bring to the US embassy for the interview to prove that I can afford studying in the US? Is just the bank statement of my father enough?

According to the [Five-Month Rule](https://studyinthestates.dhs.gov/2015/01/what-five-month-rule), all I need is my new I-20( which is being processed, but still need one or two more weeks) and paying the SEVIS fee again . However I want to make sure I do not need to get a new VISA so I wonder if any of you guys have similar experiences or know others who were in the same situation as me. (The U.S. Ambassador in my country gives mass checks recently, and one of my friends was checked 2 days ago. I do not want to risk being checked if I do not need to apply for a new F1 VISA.)"
t3_us7f1t,1,DS160 Form Mistakes,2022-05-18 07:31:36,"Hi guys, so I'm really dumb and basically made/redid the DS160 form 4 times. Each time, I noticed a mistake after submitting it (despite double checking, just not my day I guess) and so my hopefully final, 4th, DS160 form is the truly correct one (so far all seems good with this one). I wanted to ask:

1. Will this affect my chances of obtaining an F1 visa?
2. For the interview, do I just bring the 'correct' DS160 confirmation page with me?
3. I used the 4th (correct) DS160 form to schedule my interview (visa fee was paid when the 1st, incorrect, application was linked - I didn't schedule after I knew I made a mistake with the 1st application). How likely will I be asked on my previous 3 incorrect applications?

Anyway, in the DS160 forms after the 1st, I added more social media profiles - FB, Insta, LinkedIn, Twitter, Reddit, YouTube - I only use YouTube to watch videos and have no subscribers/videos uploaded whatsoever, because I did some research and it encouraged you to declare all of them.

I'm extremely confused and would like your opinion about this.

I'm doing my PhD in the US. I initially came to the country to do my Master's, and joined a different PhD program directly after (no OPT/CPT). My visa was stamped for 5 years.

I have received an opportunity to collaborate and travel to the UK, and stay there for about a month. But unfortunately my F1 will expire while I will be there. The dates aren't negotiable as my travel is part of a program and it wouldn't be just me. The program is funded, I wouldn't be spending anything out of pocket.

I don't want to lose this opportunity due to the visa stuff. The pandemic hit soon after I started my PhD so I haven't traveled at all. The one conference I attended was held online.

Out of the three, what do you think is my best option?

1. Travel to Canada or something before going to the UK, and try to renew as a TCN.

2. Apply for renewal in the UK as a TCN. This seems to be the best option but I'm terrified for being in a foreign country without my passport. In case of administrative processing, will I have to stay longer in the UK?

3. Travel to my home country (India) after the visit. This might involve me taking a break from the study, as I'm funded by my school and they expect me back right after my visit.

I haven't done anything that should make the renewal process complicated. I am funded by an assistantship, have good grades, have publications, etc. I'm getting married in a few weeks and my fiance has been picked for the H1B lottery this year, so idk if that would complicate things.

I saw that the embassy requires a passport for six months after the “intended period of stay”. Even though some countries (including mine) are exempt from this rule, it still says that the passport must be “valid for their intended period of stay”. 

Does this mean that my application may get rejected? It’s really difficult to get my passport renewed before going to the US/apply for the visa."

I noticed there was a similar question in the subreddit about retroactive payment, but [that was about CPT](https://www.reddit.com/r/f1visa/comments/ots9xp/advice_wanted_being_paid_retroactively_for_work/) and not on-campus jobs.

I had an on-campus job this past Spring semester and completed all my work before the last day of finals/program completion date. For some reason, my department HR people wanted to pay me for the work I did after the semester had finished. Last week, they asked me to fill out an I-9 form to create a ""position"" to pay me retroactively. Basically, I won't actually be doing any work for this ""position"" - HR is using it as a placeholder.  

However, I graduated two weeks ago, and therefore my I-20 work authorization expired on the last day of exams (i.e., program completion date). I have my OPT EAD in hand, but my first day is in July. Will filling out the new I-9 form with my now expired I-20 information cause any problems with USCIS for future CoS applications? I'd appreciate any answers you might have. Thanks!"

The surname section in my passport is blank and has only given name. Just got a mail from my university asking me to either get a new passport with name bifurcation or they can proceed with my current passport details, but my given names will appear under surname section (cause it’s mandatory to have a surname in US) and my first name will be blank in my I-20. 

Only problem with the second option is that it’ll later cause complications while applying for DL or SSN when in US where they require a first name also and use the passport to get those details. So eventually I’ll have to get this updated in my passport.

Now the problem I face here is that I’m from India and the current wait time to get a student visa appointment is roughly 40-50 days and I’ll have to reach US by the second week of August. Getting a slot for re-issue of passport has a minimum wait time of 10 days and I’ll only be able to get a new passport in 15-20 days from now after which only i can send it to the university for the I-20.

To my understanding it is impossible to schedule for a visa appointment without a SEVIS ID which is there in the I-20. So my question here is, rather than waiting to get a new passport, can I proceed with my current passport details for getting the I-20 (will get it in 1-2 days), proceed with scheduling of a student visa appointment (which will be in 45-50 days time) and then in the meantime apply for a new passport? 

Then once I get a new passport, I can update the university with the new details and request for the expedited issuance of the updated I-20. All I need to know is does my SEVIS ID change in the updated I-20 (I checked online and to my understanding I believe it won’t, correct me if I’m wrong) and even if it does/doesn’t change, do I need to schedule another new student visa appointment since I got an updated I-20 (because of the name change/bifurcation) or will I be able to proceed with the original visa appointment (after updating the bifurcated name on my application)? 

At present I anticipate my visa appointment to be somewhere in the 2nd/3rd week of July. But if I were to apply for a new passport now and then wait to get the first I-20, I don’t see myself getting a visa appointment before the first week of August, so hope y’all understand the situation I’m in.

TIA for your responses and for taking the time to read this."

I have a question regarding the procedure of f-1 visa renewal in India. I finished my bachelors in May 2022 in the US. I will be starting my full-time job in July,2022 in US on OPT. Currently, I am visiting India for a while and I just realized that my f1 visa will expire in july 2023. I was thinking of getting my visa renewed now in advance. I am just not sure if its the right time. But I also want to avoid getting stuck in the US with an expired visa in case I have/want to visit India after july 2023. I am concerned that I might not be able to visit India for enough time to be able to get my visa renewed after I start my job. I have been thinking of getting it renewed now but I am a little nervous that it might get rejected.Also, if I apply for renewal now will it have any negative impacts, can I still apply again? What is the exact procedure for renewal? How long does it take to get it renewed, is it a month? Is there an interview required for this?
I would really appreciate any suggestions!"

t3_v4ypv2,4,F1 Visa Cancelled without Prejudice and Administrative Processing,2022-06-04 21:38:34,"Hello everyone,

I'm in a bit of a panic here, so any advice would be incredibly helpful. I am currently on post-completion OPT (expiring soon on June 14, 2022). I recently needed to travel to my home country and since my F1 visa was expiring towards the end of June, I wanted to apply for visa renewal. However, I hadn't yet applied for OPT STEM extension before I left the US (I failed to realize I had to apply when I was in the US itself). However, making a decision I now heavily regret, I applied for F1 renewal anyway, along with a letter from my employer saying I'd be applying for my STEM OPT on my return to the US.

I submitted my F1 renewal application through the dropbox interviewless method, but it was taking a while and I started panicking, since if I didn't reach the US by June 14 and apply for my STEM extension on time, I'd go out of status. So I contacted the embassy helpline and told them I'd like to renewal withdraw my application and get my passport back so I could travel. 

They told my visa processing would take longer but since I need to travel, they would hand me my passport as my application is processing. So on Friday I went to pick up my passport thinking all was well. However, when I picked it up, my current unexpired F1 visa had a large ""CANCELLED WITHOUT PREJUDICE"" stamp over it. I also got a notice that said my visa application was under Administrative processing 221(g). That's pretty much all I got. I'm really panicking right now because my valid visa got cancelled and if I don't make it to the US by June 14 and finish applying for STEM OPT, I'm out of status. I really regret applying for renewal so late into my OPT.

Any advice would be tremendous help!"

Also, my home address listed in DSO’s system has always been my address in Georgia since I am living there. During my first two months of work, I was fully remote, and I listed the company's office in the state of California as my “physical work address” in DSO’s system. However, after my second month, I started to go to the office in the state of Georgia and changed my physical work address from California office to Georgia office.

My question is, since the initially reported physical work location (in California) is far away from my resident home address in Georgia, could this be an issue and result with an RFE for home address when I am going to apply for the STEM extension?

Also, I asked my DSO to mention in my records that I worked remotely to avoid this situation. For some reason, they are insisting on not mentioning this in my records. Should I ask about this one more time?"

On halloween 2021 I was pulled over for my front left tyre touching the yellow line, from here I was tested for drunk driving, I passed all manual roadside tests, but failed the breath test at 0.1 (in Missouri meant to be 0.08 or below). From here I was arrested. 

My lawyer appeared in court for me, I was convicted of the traffic infringement and payed the fine in court, but my DUI conviction was placed upon 'suspended', I have to complete 12m probation and then the DUI is off my record. I haven't been convicted of my DUI so far and haven't broken probation at any time. My only rule for probation was to not get arrested again. I'm a student athlete on f1 visa, this was my first encounter with the police in any country, I have now returned back to Australia for summer break to see my family. **I never received any information or contacted about my visa being revoked, I also let the school know and they never received anything either.** I have flights to go back to America for college in 2 months. Will I be ok to get in? Does everyones visa get revoked after a DUI? Lawyers told me it's a grey area and advised me not to contact the embassy incase my visa isn't revoked and then they revoke it. 

I fully understand what I did was wrong, I though I was completely safe to drive, especially in a very small town. I was meant to drop friends back off at college that were very intoxicated and ill. I would never try to put people nor my friends in danger!"

t3_v66fhu,8,Unethical University,2022-06-06 15:42:46,"I have a friend that got her B2 Visa revoked August last year after her Embassy in her country found out she previously worked for 3 months while visiting in the US. She is so desperate to move to the US her friends told her about a for profit private University on the West Coast that's all international students. Red Flags are going up as the schools not cheap and I'm afraid she is going to get caught up in a Visa Mill. The school advertises they can get any international student approved and coach them how to interview at the embassy. They even advertise on Reddit.  Sure enough she got accepted early Feb this year. She then came here for 2 weeks end of Feb strictly to party meet potential marriage partners, and came back end of March when school didn't start until May. She posting all of this on social media and not hiding it so obviously noone is looking. 

The school is apparently giving false start dates on her I-20 as no way US Customs is letting her come to party for 2 weeks, then come a month later well over 30 days before school starts. Something blatant the school is doing is giving her a cheerleading scholarship when she already has a Masters in her home country, doesn't qualify due to total semesters she's already attended school, and she's almost 35 years old😬. The school is part of NAIA and just recently CAL PAC, their IG shows nearly all their athletes are from her country, and all are either 18 or mid 30s , it looks so awkward like its students and their parents in uniform. What issues is she looking at if the school or her get audited? I'm trying to talk her into changing schools but she said the programs easy,the DSO covers for them, and she is just doing it until she marries someone for a GC🤐 

 I feel bad becuase soo many people have struggled to come here for an opportunity or dont even get a chance,  and she is basically given a red carpet imo becuase she's attractive and a master manipulator.

I am a Chilean Citizen and I have been accepted and granted a fellowship for a 1-year certificate program. The program starts on **August 15, 2022** and already received the I-20. 

In September 2019, I took a 4-Week Producing workshop. Even though it was just a 4-Week program, they recommended getting an F-1 Visa and so I did. That F-1 Visa was stamped in my previous passport which expired last year, however the F-1 Visa expiration date is **August 25, 2024**. The F1 Visa I have has an annotation with the SEVIS ID Number and the name of the academic institution from 2019.

**Can I fly and go through CBP using the previously mentioned F1 Visa and the new I-20?** From the new academic institution, they say that I could (but they need to double check).

I called the US Embassy to ask about this and the person who picked up the phone wasn't very helpful/knowledgeable. However after insisting she wasn't answering my question, she put me on hold and came back asking if the SEVIS ID number back in 2019 was the same than the new one from 2022 and I said no, so **she said I should applied for a new F1 Visa**. **I did**. The problem is that the US Embassy in Chile is taking SEVERAL MONTHS to process new requests and I am afraid they won't get me the visa on time since they are not receiving emergency appointments anymore and I should send my passport to them.

My sister is going through the same process for college but she's a little bit ahead. What is weird is that after she made her appointment application, she received an email with the next steps (send documentation to the US Embassy) with a barcode to be printed for shipping purposes. I did not receive that, and I completed my application 2 weeks ago.

I am afraid of applying for a new F1 if technically, I have one which is still valid. I've heard of people applying to Visas or ESTA while it's still valid and having issues to renovate or obtain any permission to travel to the US indefinitely. I also have an ESTA under the Visa Waiver Program which expires on August 17, 2023.

Please u/Codetornado, provide some wisdom.

- Background:

I20 amount for 1yr: 40lac
For 2yrs: 80lac

Annual income of parents combined: 11.7lac (father's: 4.86lac/mother's:6.85lac)
(Parents have been working for the past 26+ years)

Loan sanctioned: 53.5lac
Pre-visa disbursement: 51lac
Personal savings: 8 lac
Gold valuation: 6.5lac
Policies: 4-5lac
Immovable assets: approx 50-60lac


So the Sanction letter + personal savings make upto 60+ lac which is 1.5x the i20 amount and the rest I can show the liquid assets and the immovable assets.

But I've also got the pre visa disbursement of loan because we didn't have enough savings to show and was gonna show the disbursed amount as my savings

But the thing I'm worried about is can I show 50+ lac in savings with annual income around 12 lac? Also to add, my parents have been working for the more that 26 years, so would it be reasonable to say that they saved this amount since all these years.

Should I go with my original savings and assets and will they be enough OR should I add the disbursed loan amount in my savings too without causing any problem?"

But in the DS-160 form, I will mention my father as the sponsor because he is the one primarily funding my education.

Most likely, I will receive a full-time offer in January 2024. Since my graduation date is May 2023, my summer internship is from June to August 2023, and my full-time will be from January 2024. How do you recommend I navigate this?

My options are,

1. Delay graduation to Summer 2023, so I can work on CPT. Return to hometown till January 2024.
2. Graduate in May 2023, then be on OPT. Am I allowed to be unemployed on OPT?

t3_v7wrmm,1,Late Attendance (I-20 Concern),2022-06-08 18:44:17,"Hello everyone.

I need some help and advice. I’ll try and keep it brief. I am in the United States now on a non immigrant visa (B1/B2). I want to apply for an F1 visa. I got accepted into a college in Houston and everything has been working out so far. So here is the issue. I need to get my kids (two high schoolers, a middle schooler, and a kindergartner) into school, so I don’t want to be late for their sake. Considering I have to leave to my home country to get the F1 with the embassy, two months and a half seem unrealistic.

My initial I-20 application says I’ll be starting this Fall (August 23 2022). Since we’re currently in the start of June, still have not applied for the I-20 for me and my 5 dependents, and I am not eligible for an interview waiver, should I proceed with the I-20 for the Fall semester and come 2 or 3 months late or should I just switch to the spring semester starting January and have my kids miss the first semester (not very ideal because Texas curriculum is very complicated with admitting and situating K-12 students outside of the United States so my children cannot afford to go through this if we have another option [experience from a close friend])?

Does anyone also know if the I-20 date is fixed and set to program start dates of the college or if I can set it to October or September aka to my preference?

I appreciate any help at all. Thank you in advance.

TLDR; is the I-20 date flexible? If not, can I come two or three months late to the start of the Fall semester?"

t3_v9tvqc,5,Where did I go wrong with my F-1 Visa Interview?,2022-06-11 09:22:01,"My interview was scheduled for the Mumbai consulate in India. Here's how it went:

Interview scheduled for 7:50 am. I reach inside and am the first person in my row for the counter 35. VOs start coming to their counters and people start getting interviewed, but mine stays empty for an hour while I sit there waiting. Then I'm relocated to an open counter on my left, and get asked two questions:

VO: Why did you choose this university?
Me: XX university has one of the top programs in physics all around the world, and it also offered me academic enrichment opportunities like the Honors program and STARs research program. I was also offered a merit scholarship of xx, xxx dollars.

VO: What is your cgpa?
Me: (I got confused at this point due to my nervousness from waiting for an hour) Sir- we don't have cgpa in India- I haven't got the results yet-

VO: (says something I couldn't hear properly but I think it was about previous cgpa) I am nervous and confused plus I couldn't hear so I asked him to repeat three times(!!) and then said
Me: Sir I got the percentage of 90

He then gives the 214(b) and I'm so shocked at that point that I don't ask him why and just say thanks and go away.

Please offer advice on what to do on my next time and how much I should wait to reapply, since my uni starts on 12 Sept. I was confident I'd be approved but the rudeness of the VO suprised me and broke my confidence. I was also wearing formals while everyone else was in semi casuals."

For e.g. My earliest admission date is 23rd June,  my flight leaves the 22nd but my arrival into the US 23rd. Is that okay? 

  
Alternative Question: Abu Dhabi has a US CBP facility. Now if I were to use Etihad to fly, my encounter with CBP would be on the 22nd even though my landing in the US would be the 23rd. This I assume would not be ok?

1) get a really soon psychiatrist appointment bc I’m diagnosed with ADHD, and my medication is a controlled substance (Vyvanse), I have insurance through my mom’s job in the US,  plus I will probably buy another policy with the Junior College, I had Cigna as international customer but they just made my life miserable and stressful so I didn’t renew it

2) open a bank account, I’m going to keep perceiving my salary from Mexico, since I have an offer to be promoted to a manager level, I’m supposed to have a degree in anything, I’ll be making remotely stuff with no problem, always letting the company where I work that I’m a student under a student visa and studying is my priority for the next 2-4 years, I’ve been using in previous visits to the US my Mexican bank accounts but exchange rates and APR is waaaay higher than having a bank account in an American Bank

3) get a credit card or start a credit record/score on my name, since APR are ultra low from my position (MX APR’s usually are above 50%) id like to have a credit score and that, or should I try with transferring an Amex account to the US?

4) i know I’m not allowed and it’s unlawful to work as I’m a student, but what if I export stuff from the US to my home country to sell outside the US? What if I go to the casino and win? What if I have a wonderful offer to be starring in a movie? (Or similar haha) 

5) am i supposed to pay taxes from my Mexican income? Bc it’s salary + extras + trusteeships, that’s how I’m gonna get the money to pay my education in the USA

t3_vc0off,2,F-1 Interview Waiver Experience (Delhi?),2022-06-14 10:45:30,"Hello, 

Not sure if this exists but thought I'll mention a brief account of what to do for an interview waiver since I was mega confused before I got through it, hope it helps. This is from New Delhi.

Look up the place on maps, the door is on the behind, there's like two guards standing there and they won't let you go in 30 minutes before your appointment. So don't reach the place too early because you will melt if you wait there for too long due to the heat or worse get sick and then not be allowed to enter. 

Btw when you reach there are a lot of people who'd ask you if you want a photograph. If you aren't sure your photograph is good, just go with them. Seriously. They are extremely strict about the photograph. Your head is a couple of pixels away from what was asked? It won't be accepted (they'll take it, but you'll get to know a couple of days later if it's not accepted). A friend got called for an interview due to the photograph, but I'm not sure if it was the photograph or something else. He was informed his photo doesn't work, but not sure if that is what got him the interview, but I assume that was it, someone in the comments can correct me if they know.   


Whenever you get a photo clicked in your local place, literally sit with the guy and check the dimensions whenever he's doing stuff in photoshop, you don't want to risk it.  


Or just go with the dudes I mentioned, and they'll get you a perfect photo since they know what to do, but they'll ask you 500 INR, so if you don't want to pay that, just get it from your local place but carefully check it. I don't know if there's one inside the VISA place that's cheaper, I couldn't find one. If you can't find the guys, on the left side in front of the station you are at for your dropbox, you'll see a gas station, on the gas station's left there's an alley, and as you enter the alley on the right side you'll see tons of places for photos. Just tell them it's for US Visa. That's where they take you. It's expensive though so it's better to bring one yourself, but, they're less prone to fuck it up so up to you.   


Anyway, you'll go inside and there's a security check where you just put your bag on the security machine. So keep your extra luggage in your car or hotel, it's really crowded so it's gonna be pretty painful if you have luggage with you. When done with security, go to the escalator on the left side. Don't go straight and exit accidentally, because you'd have to do it all over again.    


Again, go to the escalator that takes you down another floor (it's on the left side of the previous escalator). You'll see the dropbox place right in front of you, just talk to the guard there and make sure you're at the right one. Don't go stand in a queue at the stations, talk to the same guard, and he'll check your appointment letter and send you to the correct spot.   


So you queue up and wait. When it's your turn, the guy inside will ask you for your documents.  


You don't need to bring any document other than what the Interview Document and DS-160 ask for. I brought a lot of supporting documentation and no one asked about it. This makes a lot of sense since the point of dropbox is to approve applications as fast as possible, more documents imply more work which is exactly what they're trying to avoid here. Plus they literally rubber band your documents to your passport so they couldn't ask for more documents even if they wanted. What they took from me was:  


\- I-20 (A photocopy. I was getting a new VISA renewed so I literally scanned a picture of my current I-20 and printed it from my printer. But if you just got your first I-20 make sure to sign it and your parents too if you're under 18).   
\- DS-160 (They'll take this from you. They'll give you back the last two pages with instructions on the back, but take all 3 pages with you to dropbox just in case).  
\- Appointment Confirmation (They'll give it back with a stamp).  
\- Photograph (2x2 inches)   
\- SEVIS Fee Receipt (You can get it online. You don't need re-pay the fee if you already paid it and have the same SEVIS ID. Ask your university for confirmation to see if you ever had to restart it due to a violation! If this is your first F-1 Visa, you need to pay it). 

\- Passport ofc.  


These are all required documents from DS-160 + Appointment Confirmation Letter, and basically, that's all I had to bring. F-2 might have to do more stuff, but I honestly don't know about that.   


It might take some time so make sure you have some time. I think I waited in line for 45 minutes while waiting for the guy ahead of me to get his stuff done. One other line had the same issue as mine so it's probably not all that rare to wait.   


You can check your application status online, just type CEAC VISA Status on google. I applied on a Thursday a few weeks ago and got an application received by Friday Afternoon. Saturday and Sunday was a holiday. Monday afternoon, I was administrative processing. Tuesday afternoon I had been issued a visa. 

Pretty quick, probably quicker if you don't go 2 days before a weekend like me, but still 3-4 business days is pretty fast.   


When you go to pick it up, make sure you bring your original (hardcopy) government of India-issued ID. If you have an aadhaar card, that works. I saw someone who had it on their phone and was told to get the hard copy."

t3_vcpt6e,9,Academic Integrity Violation - Will it mess up my OPT opportunity or my F-1 status?,2022-06-15 08:33:37,"Hi everyone. I'm an international student pursuing a masters degree in the US (I'm currently back in my home country for the summer).

Here's what happened.....

In March 2022, I got an invite from a classmate to join a chat group. I joined and found like more than half of my class were planning to use that chat group to share answers for a midterm exam of one class (let's call this class ""Class A""). During Class A online midterm, the exam was doable for me and I was pretty busy completing the exam on my own. I admit that I did help answering some questions asked by other students in that chat group. The chat group has been dead after that midterm exam.....

Fast forward to the end of Spring 2022 semester. Me and, like, more than 10 other students (all international students) got an email from our program director, accusing us of cheating on exams of two different classes (the midterm exam of Class A and the final exam of another class (let's call this one ""Class B"")).

Apparently, one of my classmates got caught hiring someone to complete all his assignments and the online final exam for Class B. I guess he did not want to get an F or get expelled from the university so he decided to snitch and tell the professors that we used the aforementioned chat group to cheat on Class A midterm (ok this is true) and on Class B final exam (which is absolutely A LIE). The dude told the professors that he was not the only person cheating on Class B final exam and that we ""gathered on campus"" to work on Class B final exam together probably cuz he knows that there's not gonna be any evidence since the chat group has been dead since after the midterm of Class A. He sent a screenshot containing all of the members of the chat group to the professors. The reason he did this is probably that there will now be too many students for the professors to fail, so that he can save himself.

Fortunately the professors did not choose to fail us. The program director said they decided to go with a more lenient approach since this is our first offense. Usually this incident would result in an F grade and possible expulsion. Instead, they let us sign a document concerning the academic integrity violation and retake both exams. Some of us decided to just sign the document and not defending themselves, assuming that the snitch must have already made up some shit to make the professors not listen to our excuse. At the same time, some of us tried to tell the professors admitting that we cheated for Class A midterm but not for Class B final, however, as expected, the professors decided to not listen and still told us to sign the document acknowledging about our violation and to just come and retake the exams in person.

I signed the document and took the make up exams for both classes. On that day everyone except the snitch showed up at the exam room looking so mfing confused. My final grades came out great and I'm very happy with it. However, by now there must be something about me violating the academic integrity somewhere in my records especially cuz it's two classes.

My question is will this affect my visa status or my OPT application? I can't stop worrying. Thank you so much in advanced for all the answers."

I looked up the ustraveldocs website and it says some people might be able to get a interview waiver and be able to drop off their passport for a drop-box appointment. They didn’t do a very good job of explaining the eligibility criteria and if eligible what are the steps to renew the visa. 

I wanted to ask if anybody has been in this situation in the pas and if they can help me get a quick rundown of how this process works and what documentation might be required. TIA!"

I have been dealing with some major health anxiety issues over the course of the last year or so.

&amp;#x200B;

One of the major catalysts for it is a particular animal that is very important to the eco-system yet also carries some rather dangerous diseases.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I wish to figure out a way of getting over this paranoia involving this species. One of the ways of doing that would be working closely with them and actually getting an understanding of them rather than what I imagine them to be like.

&amp;#x200B;

So, the question I have is - could I volunteer for an animal rescue organisation on an F-1 visa?"

t3_vd7857,3,Could I start a job with pre-completion OPT stay with them after graduation using a post-completion OPT?,2022-06-15 23:01:17,"Hi all, I'm just trying to workshop what kind of employment authorization will be best for me. My situation:

* PhD candidate unsure of exactly how much longer I need before submitting my dissertation. Hoping to finish in the Fall, at the latest. Somewhere between 3 and 6 months
* Just received a great job offer yesterday and this is what I would like to do after I finish. I would just have some overlap while I'm finishing up my PhD and working full-time. There's some flexibility with the start date but I don't want to push my luck too much

I was initially hoping for a post-completion OPT but realized that the EAD start date will be need to be one day after my program completion date at the earliest. So I'm looking into pre-completion OPT now. But I see that the pre-completion OPT needs to end before the program end date (makes sense) and I'm wondering if I would be able to post-completion OPT towards the end of the program? The only issue would be a potential gap in the employment dates but hopefully I can get it to be 1-2 days and maybe my employer would be okay with that (I'm guessing they'd need to ""re-hire"" me?).

Alternatively, I think maybe I can do CPT since the application timeline is quicker but I'm again unsure of what the transition to OPT would be like.

Does anyone have any insight into this?"

I had resigned from my job recently to take a break and learn some prerequisites required for my grad courses. Here's a transcript of my interview. Pls let me know what you guys think. I was not asked about my sources of funding or future plans as well. I was just given a 214b in the end. 


Program: MS CS in UC San Diego

VO: Please pass your passport

VO: Pass your i20 and sevis receipt

So UC San Diego is it?

Me: Yeah officer UC San Diego

VO: Oh put on your mask please

Me: Yes officer

VO: When did you graduate?

Me: 2021 officer

VO: What have you been doing?

Me: I was working at X as an associate software developer. I quit my job last month.

VO: Why did you quit your job?

Me: I am planning to take a few advanced courses in the fall quarter, so I wanted to prepare for that and I have been working on some personal projects related to AI

VO: Okay. So you were working at X and You took a break. How long did you work? 

Me: Yes officer I was working from July 2021 to May 2022 i.e until last month.

VO: Okay got it. What was your final year project in UG?

Me: My thesis was titled ""Multilabel Text Classification of Scientific Abstract"". I explored various Machine Learning methods to classify scientific publications and research articles. The results were also published in springer.

VO: Oh you published the results?

Me: Yeah it was published in springer 

VO: What is your father doing?

Me: He is currently working as a headmaster in a state government school and his annual income is X lakhs rupeess which is equivalent to Y usd.

Me: Yeah done

VO: Please place both of your thumbs

Me: Done

VO: Im not able to approve your visa right now and I can't explain any further. You may try again.


I had 2x the i20 amount which includes my father's savings and  an educational loan and the VO didn't even ask me about it. I don't understand what went wrong here. I thought leaving the job would have been the reason but I see a lot of people with a year gap and people who had quit 5-6 months before the visa interview getting an approval."

With just around a month remaining before my STEM OPT expires, should I pressure the recruiter to give me an offer quickly as possible, or does that risk a rejection? 

If I get the job offer after visa expiration, it is not possible to get a visa in the US or apply for one for a different country from the US which would lengthen the process further with me having to fly back to my home country. And that scenario might turn into a rejection. Should I stay put or just take the gamble and back the recruiter into a corner?

t3_vglvzb,4,Working over 20 hours on Part time CPT and holding another campus job?,2022-06-20 13:46:05,"I’ll keep this simple:

- Summer semester

- I have an on campus job where I usually work between 20-25 hours a week

- Got an internship late so the manager said I could work part time and do the other job.

- Internship was approved by department and  I am getting credit for that. I was authorized for part time CPT since the internship is part time. 

Now the part I’m scared/confused about is that if I work maximum on both the jobs it would work up to 45 hours a week. 
Would that be alright on my F1 visa?(only for the summer semester)

Follow up question, will I be able to work overtime at my internship if I have only part time authorization?


Would appreciate any insight!"
t3_vgpffq,1,Changing University after booking VISA appointment,2022-06-20 16:26:16,"I’m from India and I am enrolled in University A for my undergraduate studies and I have an I20 from them. I have been waitlisted at University B which is my dream school and I would enroll if I got off the waitlist. University B releases waitlist decisions until the end of June.

I have a valid B2 visa that I got in 2017, and thus I am eligible for the Dropbox Appointment.

Since visa slots are filling up quickly, I was thinking of filling the DS160, SEVIS fee and applying for my visa appointment now instead of waiting for the end of June (almost 2 business weeks away).

In case I get off the waitlist for University B, what is the process of changing my university after I have booked my visa appointment and have paid the fee for the same?

t3_vgz9ri,2,Private Loan for F1 Proof of Funds?,2022-06-20 23:43:21,"Hey all,

Posting this on behalf of my roommate who is currently abroad. Some backstory: He's an international student who recently graduated from his undergraduate program. He was accepted into a Master's program at his same institution but his F1 visa expired so he went back to his home country (Korea). He's applying for his F1 Visa again (long story short, he can't do the interview waiver/document review and has to interview). The embassy website states that he would need to bring some financial documents to prove his ability to pay for his program. He's already been issued an I-20 by his institution

Things are a little sticky there though as, while he did have the funds via his parents before, difficult times have set that back. He's now panicking as his interview is in August and he isn't sure he can show proof of funds when he goes to the interview, even though . He is also concerned a loan from a family member that is deposited into the bank account would be grounds for denial for his F1 Visa

Our question is-- **If he took out a private bank loan to fund his education would that be accepted for his F1 Visa application?**"

I'm returning here because many of you were able to help me getting my F1 visa when no appointments were available. This is a great community.  


Again I have come to you for help...  


I just had a first-stage interview with my dream company. There is no place in the world I'd rather work than there. The interview seemed to go quite well and they seemed to be interested, but unfortunately I was informed that their HR has a policy where they won't hire anyone who is on an OPT. This is, btw, not the first company that told me this (every company that told me this also told me they started this policy during covid, why?).  


It sucks to hear that, but they went into this interview knowing that I'm a foreign student currently, and that my situation would look like this. They didn't close the door on me either and said they'll be discussing my situation more and get back to me. So, I think that if I present some options that are favorable to them, I have a good shot at this. My question therefore is this:  


**What are the incentives for companies that make companies refuse OPT hires and what can be done to convince HR departments that it won't be as big of an issue as they think?**  


I'm currently looking into STEM-extensions or doing a master after this one so I can do multiple OPTs back to back or something. Any other creative solutions like that would be welcome."

t3_vjdc1q,3,"As an Iranian National on an F1, can I ever leave the U.S. safely?? :(",2022-06-24 02:11:31,"So I’m an iranian national. I entered US on a J2 visa in 2016, switched to F1 in 2018-2019 and am currently on OPT. 
The F1 in my passport expired a year or so after I entered the US. 
I’m in my early 20s and have always wanted to travel but had always been advised against leaving the country while in school, i was told by my DSO Itll be better after I graduate. 

Now with my OPT and a job offer I was again strongly advised against leaving the country as the chances of me getting a non-immigrant (F1) to get back into the US will be low, especially as I am an iranian and have my immediate family residing in the US (and they are permanent residents now). 

Will I ever be able to leave the country? I feel like I’ve been held hostage and I’ll never be able to return once I leave. :( 
I realized even if I start my masters or PhD I’m still in the same boat where I get an extension on my I-20 and not a visa in my passport so I practically can never leave the country, right? 

Is there any scenario now or in the future where I could leave and travel safely ? 

I’m feeling defeated so any shared experience or guidance would be much appreciated!"

So I submitted my OPT STEM Extension application online on June 14 at around 11pm EST.

The payment confirmation email I got said the transaction date was June 15, 3am (which was the UTC time at the time).

I wanted to know whether this was a problem so I tried to contact USCIS. I finally got through to a representative and all they told me that I could write a to USCIS at the address mentioned on my receipt notice.

I just wanted to know if anyone else had experience sending out letters to USCIS like this, whether it worked and is a good idea, and what other documents (needed for USCIS to identify my case) needs to be send. Any insight would be really appreciated!"

Thanks in advance for reading and any advice. 

I’m a permanent resident in Southern California. My sister just got her her f1 visa approved for fashion designing at Thomas Jefferson university , New Jersey. 


Here is the background: my idea to get my sister here and then transfer her out to a community college or school near me near Los Angeles so that she can save stay with me which will save her a bunch of money as they university she got visa approved is expensive . 

She will be here by July 15 and her classes start around first week of august . 

How can I manage this situation.

So mummy and I started a catering business from home and we did well. This happened way back in 2004. But the desire to go back to college was always alive however life took over. In 2019 Daddy passed away and in 2020 my only sibling too, suddenly, unexpectedly passed due to complications caused by covid. Mummy had no more interest in business and I wanted a change in career too. A more exciting one that doesn’t limit me to the kitchen. I applied for Masters in Clinical Mental Health Counselling.

Finally l, one college showed a unique pathway. They said, study Masters in Biblical Spiritual foundation and discipleship for 3 semesters, do well and we will allow you to transfer to CMHC. I was elated! Finally, I can begin working on my passion to learn about the various ways to reach out to the hurting. My passion was to work with widows. My mom is a widow and so is my best friend. I know how they suffer and the stigma attached to mental health in India doesn’t help at all. I decided that I will come back to India and set up a counselling centre for widows and teens. I believed that this is my calling until the day of visa stamping! My application was rejected! I understand that we applied as a family but I have never stepped out of the country on my own and I was terrified of the prospect! I wanted my family( spouse and kids)  with me at least for a few months or for the first year of my studies and they could head back home while I took another year to complete the course but that was not to be.

Hey all,

So I had a VISA appointment in about a month, but luckily was able to reschedule to one tomorrow (Monday). Unfortunately I had not paid my SEVIS fees yet, it is for an F-1 visa. I have paid them now and have the receipt but it says there should be at least 3 business days before the moment I paid my fees and my VISA appointment at the consulate.

Since I was only able to reschedule on Friday (2 days ago), the 3 business days delay is not completed. I don't even have the option to reschedule anymore, so close to the appointment.

If by any chance someone went through this, what should I do? Can I explain my situation during the appointment or should I call early tomorrow to try and reschedule (which might be too late for me to start university on time)? As I said I have the paiement receipt but I guess the 3 days delay is to make sure the credit card payment is processed.

My brother is working in Amazon (Seattle) though he is not American but Canadian. He won't be sponsoring my education but I don't know what to say if the visa officer asked me about him. I have seen a few people who are rejected as soon as they show they have some relative in the states.

I left the US, reapplied and was granted a new F1 Visa, then spent the next 6 years in the US where I completed both my bachelor and master in engineering. I have been working for my current company as an engineer for the past 1.5 years now (after completing my studies and was initially working on OPT) and we completed the PWD+PERM. I just recently received an email from the company's lawyer that I may get an RFE for my F1 visa violation from 6 years ago during the AOS (I485). That was my only offense/violation. So my questions are:

1. How likely will I get an RFE?
2. if I get an RFE, what other evidence can I provide since I already explained in the form what happened?

I would like to mention that I was asked about prior violation during my second VISA application(DS-160 and in person at the embassy) and and I told the US officer what happened and he granted me the visa. When filing both H1B and PERM, I was also asked that question and both were approved without RFE(and I stated in the form my violation). I am just wondering why I could get an RFE this time?"

I recently applied for a US F1 visa in order to pursue my graduate studies in the US. I also mentioned that my parents will not be accompanying me during my travel in my DS-160 form. About a week ago, I got my visa approved and stamped and everything is great!

Here's where the tricky part starts. My sister, who lives in Canada, recently bought a house and invited my parents to a house-warming event. Seeing as how my sister's home (in Toronto) is only an hour away to my university (close to Washington DC) by air, they wanted me to visit Canada with them (I have a Canadian tourist visa) and then have all three of us enter the US together (they have a US visit visa).

Is this going to be a problem at immigration? I'm guessing my trip from my home country to Canada should be no problem. But, I'm expecting a lot of questions to be asked at Toronto before I board my flight to DC. Some of them I can think of from the top of my head are:

1. Why I'm travelling with my parents when I specifically mentioned that they wouldn't be travelling with me in my DS-160?
2. Why am I entering the country from Canada?

Or, am I thinking too much? Any help would be appreciated."

Looking around, I found that my nation is a member of the US visa waiver program, which partially qualifies me for the drop-off visa services (Interview Waiver).

[https://www.ustraveldocs.com/tw/tw-niv-visarenew.asp#Qualifications](https://www.ustraveldocs.com/tw/tw-niv-visarenew.asp#Qualifications)

However, under "" **Qualification for Drop-off Service Based on First-Time F, M, and Academic J Visas, (through December 31, 2022):** ""

I do not meet this condition: 

1: You were previously issued any type of U.S. visa which must have been issued to you when you were **age 14 or older**, and your **fingerprints** must have been collected during the visa application. (AIT began taking ten-finger fingerprints for visa applicants on November 7, 2007.) 

**OR:**

2: You are a citizen of Taiwan or another [**Visa Waiver Program (VWP)**](https://www.ustraveldocs.com/tw/tw-niv-visawaiverinfo.asp) participating country, and have previously traveled to the United States using an authorization obtained via the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) on **or after your 14th** **birthday**.

&amp;#x200B;

Would it be possible to qualify for the second condition by literally just making a roundtrip a week from now in the US and back home? I would enter with no visa, with (visitor visa reasons: [https://www.ustraveldocs.com/tw/tw-niv-visawaiverinfo.asp](https://www.ustraveldocs.com/tw/tw-niv-visawaiverinfo.asp)), as Taiwanese citizens should be able to do under the visa waiver program, thereby qualifying me for the second condition, entering the US using the Visa Waiver Program with an auth. obtained via the ESTA system (after my 14th birthday).

I had my F1 visa interview at Mumbai consulate on 15th June and got handed a 221g slip asking for additional information. Since I applied for MS Robotics course and I have shown interest in drone technology I am worried that I might not get my visa approved. I have given all the extra information the VO asked for but haven't received any acknowledgement or anything.

Can someone confirm that whether or not they send an acknowledgement and also any tips in general?

Thanks :)"

t3_vpf6r3,0,OPT Work and Major Relationship,2022-07-02 00:28:20,"I know this probably has been asked a few times already but since I see that the posts are mainly about CS/BA majors trying to work in a field that is in grey areas, I wanted to bring up a case in healthcare/public health fields. Would a **Quality Nurse** job (in Community/Primary Care settings) that entails work in project management, quality improvement, and health promotion initiatives be logically and directly related to a Master's of Public Health and Health Management degree? I myself, if I were to explain to an immigration officer, I would say it is directly related because project management and quality improvement work requires knowledge of health system and health program evaluation knowledge, which are major parts of what students in MPH degrees learn. The health promotion part (including analyze disease trend in this community and designing projects to help lower disease burden) is even more obvious as far as I see it, directly related to the field of Public Health.

Although I do realize that the job title is ultimately ""Nurse"", but it is not uncommon to see nurses do public health works everywhere, especially in the U.S. where you have a lot of nurses being in positions in health departments and etc doing public health works.

t3_vqj4wq,14,Inquiry on Mistakes on DS-160 and DS-5535,2022-07-03 14:43:47,"Hi everyone,


I applied for an F-1 visa back in May this year, and I have come to realize that I may have made some mistakes in my DS-160 and 5535. I was wondering if this could cause a denial of my F-1, which is currently in AP? I'm pretty sure these mistakes aren't material, but I've been rather anxious for the past little while. I would really appreciate if someone could have some input on this :)


Situation: On my DS-160, it says to list my last 5 trips to the US. I have been in the states 3 times (2007, 2011 and 2019), but I genuinely did not read the question carefully. Since the question below it asks for my most recent visa details, I carelessly just only put in details of my last US visit (the 2019 one) in the question above. I know they probably have the details of my other trips, but does the fact that I genuinely forgot to mention the others a potential reason for rejection? I have no overstays/criminal records; it was just simple carelessness. I'm not sure if it makes the situation any better, but early last month when I realized it, I did send the consulate an email explaining the situation and including the remaining trips (+ pictures of my corresponding visas). I also included details such as my social security number in the original DS-160, so I really wasn't trying to hide anything. Not sure if that helps?


Secondly, I was nonchalantly handed a physical copy of the DS-5535 in my interview. I did not know what it was back then, so for the sake of time I sort of hastily filled it in at a counter and gave it back. On it, I listed some of my most important travel histories (such as my 4 years in Canada as an undergraduate and my 1 year as a J-1 research assistant in an Ivy League university). I saw that the space didn't allow for a lot of details, so I just left it at that and handed it in. I haven't been to any countries that have poor relations with the US (Canada, US, Korea, UK, China, Taiwan, Japan, Indonesia and Australia), and I have no negative records, but perhaps by omitting that I could be denied my F-1? I did also include that list of countries in my amendment email to the consulate.


Sorry for the long post, but thanks again for any feedback!

Edit: I received my F-1 on July 11th, which was approximately 8 weeks after my interview!"

t3_vsv5kj,12,Options to remain in the US during academic suspension,2022-07-06 17:15:12,"Hi, I'm an international student currently being suspended for one semester due to underperformance in the previous two semesters. It's a difficult time for me to leave the US since my parents are abroad as well, and returning to my home country comes at an extremely high cost. I have asked the international program office and academic advisor at my university for options. OPT doesn't seem to be a viable option, since I'm majoring in computer engineering, and looking for an internship with my status is pretty much impossible. And enrolling in community college is also not a great option, because I just finished my junior year and there aren't many courses left for me to take except engineering courses. Are there any viable options for me to stay for this semester? I also possess a valid R B1/B2 visa. Do I have any options for remaining here for half a year? If I just stay here for one semester, will I be in any trouble?

Thanks

My program end date was July 1st, 2022. My post doc starts on September 1, 2022.

I am just noticing this (was frantically finishing dissertation until a few days ago) and am not sure what to do. I know from talking to my school's international office that I need to file for a correction, but this is all complicated by unchangeable travel plans abroad during august. I am away from mid july to late august, when I would need to re-enter the US.

Any experience/advice on whether you can enter the US with wrong dates on your EAD card? Can I begin work on September 1st with the current card and \*then\* file for correction? Will I be in trouble already for being outside the 90-day unemployment range, if they start counting from May 17th?

Would they be called or emailed by the consulate?

II. F1 Visa. If I will be traveling with my kids, do I need to mention that I will be traveling with them while filling the DS160 or should I wait to get the visa first, so that they can apply for f2?

Or should I apply for f2 for them immediately and go with them for my f1 interview?

May 11th: Signed all the forms and sent everything over to them to apply. 

May 16th: They applied after I sent multiple emails to apply asap.

May 17th: Status changed to “Recieved”.

May 19th: Got the receipt mail.

June 27th: Application got approved. Status changed to “Card is being produced”. I checked everyday on opttimeline.com and the approvals gradually reached my receipt date.

June 30th: “Card was produced”.
Now it stayed at this status till July 6th. 

July 6th: Status changed to “Mail was picked by USPS on July 1st”. And they provided the tracking number.

Now I did not check the forms properly but apparently the card was sent to my attorney at Fragomen. USPS said they delivered the mail on July 5th but Fragomen did not send any email about it until I asked everyday if it was sent or not. They finally got back to me on July 7th saying they will send my card next week for some reason. So I called my attorney and asked to send the EAD card this week itself. After multiple emails and requests, they finally sent my EAD card and I got it on July 8th. 

I have not had a good experience with fragomen so far because they just take too long to get back and apply for stuff. The only plus side is that we don’t have to do everything on our own."

I have been studying at my university for 3 years now, and I'm graduating in May 2023. However, I'm planning to take a gap semester this Fall 2022 to go back to my home country for some personal reasons. I plan to return to the US within 5 months. I understand that during the time of my gap semester, my status will be ""terminated"".

When I asked my DSO, they said that I before I return, I can get my status ""reactivated"" because my leave is less than 5 months. However, this request to reactivate my status is approved my SEVP and there's no guarantee. I've done research and there are no clear guidelines that state explicitly the reasons for denial of a I-20 reactivation request. Therefore, I'm asking if any of you have been in the same situation or knows someone who has been in this situation (take a gap semester and return within 5 months) because I want to return on the same SEVIS ID to retain my CPT benefits for summer 2023.

Are international students (second year/sophomore) students (on F1 visa) working an on campus job (paid) required to file taxes? In the last tax cycle, I didn't have any income and hence had filled and physically mailed form 8843 which is the exemption form for international students with no income. But, in the upcoming tax cycle, if I have an income for an on campus job, do I have to fill any form for taxes? Will I have to pay any taxes or am I exempted from it? If not exempted, how much do I have to pay? How is that calculated and is that amount already deducted from the pay check? 

 Is there a official website where I can see who is eligible to pay taxes and who is eligible to get exempted from this requirement?

t3_vy34u3,8,OPT applied on June 22nd. Job start date on August 8th. Should I tell my employer that I may be delayed?,2022-07-13 13:22:19,"Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

I applied for OPT on June 22nd. When I look up on USCIS page about OPT processing times, they say 30 days. When I asked my immigration advisor they said the current general processing time seems to be between 40 and 50 days and in any case it is somewhat optimistic that I may be able to start on August 8th. 

For some reason, I have a gut feeling that the USCIS OPT processing estimate of 30 days is misleading. My friend who applied on May 5th just got their OPT approved so it took them close to 60 days. 

Should I tell my employer that I may be expecting a delay of at least close to 20 days with a 60 day estimate? I am the first international student that needs a visa sponsorship that my employer has hired and I do not want to give them cold feet unneccessarily."

We have the following questions:

1. I know OPT can take a while to get approved but the approval odds seem almost 100%. Is it ok to accept them now or do we need to wait until they can prove full legal status for the duration of the lease?
2. If we accept him and his OPT gets denied, do we need to evict him or could they stay? how many days would they have under a grace period to leave the US?

I hope to get some advise regarding my name. Anything would be appreciated. Let’s say my given name is “XY” my surname is “Z” (No middle name). 

Last time I went back, I renewed my passport due to expiration date. I got my new passport, got the visa stamp from drop-off option, have no problems at all, both at the US immigration and the embassy. 

After I came back, I transferred to another school and realized the new passport has a space in between my first name “X Y” (X&lt;Y&lt;Z). My new I-20’s given name “X Y” and surname “Z”. 

I plan to go back next month to renew my passport with my first name without space, and following the drop off instruction since there was no issue last time. 

But I’m concerned that it might be causing trouble this time since my new school’s transcript has a note stating that “Name changed via petition” which a petition that my international center filed to match my passport for me. 

I don’t know if I should (1) email to the embassy to let them know ahead and probably get to do a more strict interview and questions about this issue. 

(2) just renew my passport like last time and go for drop-off method and wait to see if I get call back for interview or providing additional documents. 

(3) renew my passport, correct my name in I-20 from school and wait for new I-20 to match my new passport, then go for dropping off method.

t3_vzmzog,3,Visa approved but passport returned with no visa,2022-07-15 12:02:16,"I am going to present my timeline of the process in order for you to get a clear picture.

&amp;#x200B;

**July 3rd, 10 am**: I attended my F-1 visa interview. At the end of the interview, I was informed by the visa officer that my visa has been approved and I will receive my passport in one week's time. She informs me that the earliest date of entry into the United States is the one specified on my I-20. Along with this, she also hands me a paper which covers ""**Tips for studying in the United States"".**

**July 3rd, 11.30 am**: I check my visa status on CEAC and it has the following text:

""

**Refused**

A U.S. consular officer has adjudicated and refused your visa application. Please follow any instructions provided by the consular officer. If you were informed by the consular officer that your case was refused for administrative processing, your case will remain refused while undergoing such processing. You will receive another adjudication once such processing is complete. Please be advised that the processing time varies and that you will be contacted if additional information is needed. For more information, please visit TRAVEL.STATE.GOV or the website for the Embassy or Consulate at which you made your visa application.

""

Concerned by this message, I googled to check if this is a common occurrence. I came across the following post on this subreddit:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/f1visa/comments/ncmlvn/visa\_officer\_said\_approved\_and\_kept\_passport\_but/](https://www.reddit.com/r/f1visa/comments/ncmlvn/visa_officer_said_approved_and_kept_passport_but/)

After going through the post and the comments, I was convinced that this was just a regular error and I have nothing to worry about.

&amp;#x200B;

**July 4th**: Holiday for Independence Day

&amp;#x200B;

**July 7th**: I receive my passport back from the consulate with no visa and along with the passport, I received a letter with the following contents:

""

You currently have a non-immigrant visa application pending at the US Consulate General.

We are returning your passport and all documents via Aramex, as our office will be closed from **July 8th 2022 to July 13th 2022** for Eid al-Adha. We will re-open on Thursday, **July 14th 2022**. If we have requested additional information from you, please return the requested information and your passport after Eid via Aramex. If your case is undergoing administrative processing, please wait until we ask you to return your passport. **We will not be able to process any visas** **or respond to any emails during the holidays**

**""**

I was not informed by the visa officer or by any other correspondence that my application has been put under administrative processing. During all this time, the visa application status on CEAC has remained unchanged.

Since they have sent back my passport, I am concerned as to when the visa application will proceed. Since my passport was returned to me completely unchanged, I am assuming that it cannot mean that my visa has been denied. 

So I have the following questions:

1. Does anyone know if this is a common case? Does the consulate send back pending visa passports before a holiday break? 
2. Should I be concerned that my passport was returned without a visa? 
3. Should I send back my passport immediately after the Eid holidays or should I wait for the Consulate to contact me? 
4. If someone's visa gets denied, does the consulate leave a stamp or some indication on the applicant's passport that the visa has been refused?

**Note:** Out of 12 days since my visa interview, only 4 of them have been working days."

My father received a government scholarship in 2008 for a masters then a Ph.d then a opt. My family and I were f-2 dependents under his visa. 

My parents divorced in 2017 and I cut off contacts with my father while still remaining under his f-1 status.

In 2019, after 2 semesters I saw no chance of me getting the scholarship so I went home. My status was still valid for another month. The same year I came to learn that my father was seeking asylum in the US. 

Now I received a fully funded merit based scholarship to the The Ohio state university. 3 hours away from the school my dad used to go to. I was refused a f-1 visa last month under 214(b). My next appointment is July 25.

My boyfriend is from South Korea, and is currently in the US on an F1 visa. He recently lost his passport that contained his F1 in the US and just received a new one. We live in different states and he is planning on flying to see me soon. Will he still be able to travel domestically within the United States, despite not having a new F1 visa in his new passport yet? He has all the documents for his original F1, but I’m not sure if that makes a difference in this case.

Any help in regards to this issue is much appreciated and thank you in advanced 😊"

Applied to 6 universities, got accepted into 3. (7th university directly stopped my application stating minimum requirements) Got my i20 for MS in Information Systems at Northeastern University.

Have over 2 years of work experience(excluding internships) in India, and currently earn 25lpa. Completed my undergrad in Computer Science from one of the newer Indian Institutes of Technology in 2020(Counts as Tier 1 in India). Family is financially stable enough to support me for the complete duration of my program - still took a loan of 40 lakhs, almost equal to the tution fees, since those with approved loans apparently have a higher chance getting visa. GRE 328, toefl 108. 

The biggest reason i couldn't get into more competitive programs was my CGPA. It's 6 on a scale of 10, and 7.8 in my final year of undergrad. Completely wasted 3 years playing games, reading novels, &amp; music. Still banked on the my SOP to show off ny profile that was always in the top 1% easily at everything i did, and the strong LORs from my professors, especially from the prof who evaluated my final year bachelor thesis and gave me a 9/10. Got a strong work LOR from the VP of engineering at my company too. 

Had my interview today. Went like this:

How many universities did you apply to, and how many admitted? - 6 applied, and 3 admitted

How much was your undergraduate gpa? - 6 on a scale of 10, 7.8 in my final year.

When did you graduate? - 2020

Please place your 4 fingers on the scanner. Sorry to inform you that i cannot approve your visa now.

I said thanks and left. Was kinda shocked to face this. I knew that the low GPA would hit my admits hard, but didn't expect that visa would prove to be the biggest hurdle.

Edit - I was handed back my passport, along with a copy of Section 214(b) - Did not overcome the presumption of Immigrant intent, as the denial reason."

I haven’t been to India since Jan 2020, and looking at the H1B visa slots, I’m not sure I’ll be able to travel again until mid 2023. So I am planning to travel in the next month, apply for F1 visa renewal (eligible for drop box) and return by the end of August. 

Since I have an approved H1B, does this raise a flag about immigration intent when I apply for my F1 renewal? 

I have been monitoring visagrader.com for recent statistics on the approval rate. It appears there are quite a lot of refusals / admin processing for F1 dropbox appointments. Any idea what the reasons could be for such high rejections ? 
This scares me, since I have my PhD defense in the fall semester.

I have just received this email from the embassy explaining that they are not ready to receive my documents just yet. The email states:

“You have successfully completed the U.S. visa application registration process. Based on the information you provided, you are not required to attend a consular interview at this time. Due to the high demand of visa applications, the U.S. Department of State has placed your case in the virtual “waiting” queue. When the Consular Section is ready to review your application, we will send application submission instructions to the email address you provided when creating your account in this system. Please be advised that it can take several weeks or months before you receive this email.

Failure to follow the application submission instructions will significantly delay processing your visa application, as your documents will be returned to you and you will be required to schedule an in-person interview appointment.

Note: Please be advised that call center and support desk agents do not have information regarding when you will receive this email and cannot expedite the process.”

The operator I spoke to told me that the average time from submission of documents to visa being issued is 21 working days. This meant that if I was to send my documents tomorrow, I could expect to receive my visa on the 19th of August. I am hoping to get to the states by the 15th of August as my classes start on the 22nd.

During this time, COVID-19 had just begun and we decided to fly back to out respective countries for fear that we might contract the virus. And during that time I had taken a gap year from school to take a break from school and start coping with the pandemic. It was at that time where my current wife had visited me in my country. She then decided to apply for an F1 visa so that she could complete her degree and be with me. She applied and failed the interview twice before she got approved, this happened on December last year. Fast-forward to now, we just got married in May and she no longer thinks she should study and wants to change to an F-2 visa instead.

&amp;#x200B;

Questions I have:

1) Does this raise red flags and make it likely that she will lose her F-1 visa if they reject her F2 visa.

2) We are currently touring europe and plan on visiting my home country. Should she apply for the F2 visa there or apply for the change while she is in the US?

3) Given how strict and assuming the interviewers are(personal experience), should she just study a little bit longer before she applies for the f2 Visa? My fear is that she had changed her visa status one too many times."

t3_w6h7z8,1,Traveling / renewing F1 visa while STEM OPT pending,2022-07-23 23:26:08,"Happy Saturday all! My regular post-completion OPT expired July 21, and I'm currently waiting for my STEM extension to be approved. I got my receipt notice on July 1. Back in March, I planned foreign travel with a departure date of August 3, not anticipating the delays I would face in getting my employer to complete their portion of the I-983.

Assuming **I don’t have my EAD** by August 3—which seems likely given current processing times—is it advisable to continue with my travel plans, specifically considering the following:

(1) I will need to renew my F-1 visa while I am home (Ireland). Would not having the EAD by the time of the consular appointment impede that process?

(1) if renewing the visa is possible, but by the time of my planned return to the United States, my case still has not been processed, will it be possible to re-enter without an active EAD? I do have my physical receipt notice and of course my latest I-20 with the STEM extension request on it

If my STEM OPT is approved and EAD sent **after I leave but before I return**, I can arrange to have a friend pick it up from my mailbox and overnight it to my family's place in Ireland. However, this would only work if I don't need to be physically present for the delivery of my EAD. Last time, per my University's instructions, I had it sent to the international center and they then forwarded it to my (then) US address via UPS, but this time I just put in my own US address, so I have no experience receiving the EAD directly. Do I actually need to be home to receive the card?"

t3_w7emy3,4,Mod Reminder: Illegal Advice Gets you a Ban,2022-07-25 03:52:59,"I have had to ban several people today for posting illegal advice.   
**I want to be 100% clear.** Illegal advice gets you a permanent ban. Full stop. No appeals. No warnings. 

Bad, incorrect, or illegal advice will be removed. If this becomes a pattern, you will also be banned. No appeals.

I took over r/f1visa several years ago to address the constant bad advice for F-1 students. As we have substantially increased subscribers, I want to post this as a reminder. Additionally, as some of you may have noticed I added /u/GRRAWorld as a moderator to help with the increase in traffic.

Reminder: If you do not know, do not post.   

We are looking for informed answers only. No illegal advice. There is enough bad advice out there already and individuals taking money from F-1 students and giving them bad advice. There are enough misconceptions out there and individuals who try to make sense of items and come up with weird ideas and concepts of how immigration works.

Finally, if you see bad advice, bad spots, etc. please report it using the report feature. We want this to be a strong community supporting F-1 students."

I have been working since I got my OPT card from USCIS, I disregarded DSO ""permission"". Basically, I will be joining my professor for research that is conducting at the company that I work in; on top of my main position duties (as healthcare clinician). My school said I can get a letter from my professor and clinical supervisor, but also stated that I cannot work until I get approval from DSO or she will terminate my student record.

I have been working using DED-EAD (after I got my OPT-EAD), but I also gave my OPT-EAD to my employer stating they are both active. My question is that should I disclose that I am already working using my DED-EAD to my DSO. I have a strong feeling that she will terminate my record after that? I tried to call SEVP hotline but they refuse to escalate the problem for me. And I still do not have access to SEVP-Portal due to my school won't create a IT ticket for me (as DSO unable to reset my SEVP account).

My goal is to try to convince the council that I’m planning to return to my country after my college year is over. Does anyone have any suggestions?"

t3_w995zb,8,F1 visa interview for residents of UAE,2022-07-27 08:28:48,I am an investor visa/golden visa holder at UAE. I have my investments in real estate and I plan to reside next year in Dubai. Will I be able to apply for an F1 visa from Dubai since I'm a resident/investor over here. I got my previous US visa( F1 visa) from my country and was never denied any US visa nor did I ever overstay my visit at the US. There is a visa interview date waiting time in my country for the next two years. So I'm unable to get an appointment date over there. And since I have investments here in Dubai and plan to reside the next year here I was considering applying for an F1 visa from here. Any advice or experiences of similar scenarios will be helpful. I'm curious to know whether I will have any issue getting an F1 visa from here or not and whether I'm eligible to apply for an F1 visa from Dubai as an investor/resident or not.
t3_w9daf8,1,Rejected twice under 214b; attempt a third time or no chance?,2022-07-27 12:19:26,"For context, we’re a family of 7. 2 parents and 5 children, and until recently only 3 of the children were adults and were working. My mother, my youngest sibling, and I (recently graduated from HS and turned 18) were living in the US using F1 and F2 visas. We are Palestinian and we had our visas on our Palestinian passports and recently we were able to get hold of new Turkish passports. My mother’s visa was ending soon, I needed to go back to apply for my own F1, and we wanted to put the visas on our new passports, so we headed back to Saudi Arabia.

For the first interview, my mother and I applied as F1s with my youngest sister and father applying for F2s with us. My mother misspoke and accidentally said she was planning to stay for 2 years when she only needed 1 year to finish her degree, she thought that the interviewer was asking her how many years will the visa give you. When the interview ended, I got my visa accepted while my mother and the rest were rejected. Of course with a lot of our stuff and plans back in the US, we were quick to get another appointment for my mother and youngest sister.

The second interview, the interviewer, from what my mother described, essentially went rogue. They asked weird questions. Like,

Last time you applied as 4, why only 2 this time?
She answered because I got accepted

Why is he (me) going to the US? What college is your son going to? Why that college? What degree is he planning to take? 

Who are [she said the names of the 2 other children that never came with us to the US]? How many children do you have?

She said something about how it didn’t show up that my mother had a visa, which my mother explained the other visa was on a different passport. The interviewer then asked why did we change passports, to which my mother said something along the lines of “we had trouble renewing the Palestinian one”

My mother, according to her, answered honestly and concisely. And of course, she got rejected a second time. My mother was good student, getting and maintaining a GPA of 3.8+ while in the US and we have significant proof of financial ability to fund the thing. Should we apply for the third time or does it seem like there is no shot?"

I saw some previous posts that suggested trying to request dso to create sevis help desk ticket. Has that worked for anyone?

According to the uscis website, records get automatically terminated after 46 (31+15) days however this rule has been paused due to COVID. Does this mean if I don’t get a termination notice in 15 days I might be okay?

I am new to Reddit and I am on F1-OPT, graduated in August 2021, and am currently eligible for applying for STEM OPT Extension. I got i983 from my employer and requested for i20 from my college. I have a query regarding the i765 form (to be submitted to USCIS). The DSO has instructed me to choose the option of (1a) Initial permission to accept employment instead of (1c) Renewal of my permission to accept employment. But my immigration attorney recommended me to still choose (1c) and they are not aware of any update from USCIS regarding this update. All my friends and colleagues who have applied for STEM OPT Extension (even recently) have chosen the option of (1c), not (1a). The DSO said that the option change from (1c) to (1a) happened recently and has been communicated with other colleges in the US. Did anyone else also get the exact instructions from their DSO? Does anyone know if USCIS has sent any updates regarding this? I am worried that choosing the wrong option in i765 form will lead to USCIS denying my STEM OPT Extension application.

Initially, on my passport, I did not have a surname and both my names were under the given name field (Given Name - ABC DEF, Surname - Empty). This has led to me having FNU on my F-1 visa, I-20, and EAD. 

I got my passport renewed in the US and I got my name split (Given Name - ABC, Surname - DEF) and I have corrected it on my SEVIS account and I-20. Next, I have to correct my EAD card by mailing a physical application to USCIS. 

Here are my questions:
1. I would like to know if anyone has done it before and what additional documents should I present as evidence. 
2. I would also like to know if I will get a new receipt number so that I can track the status, and if not, how do I track this application. 
3. I see that OPT applications are being processed in about 1.5 months. Should this request be processed around the same timeline or would it take longer as there is a change in personal details?

P.s. My F-1 visa is expired so I will not have to change the name on the visa until I leave the US to get another visa stamped.

I'm currently a email customer support executive for well reputed US company headquartered in California. It's one of the top 50 apps in the app Store.

Also I graduated in the year 2018 with a UG degree in chemical engineering. 

Now, I want to change my career to data/business analytics field and study in the US. 
I reached out to some colleges via email and they said they will consider a candidate like me for MSIS in 3 to 4 colleges. 

I'm confident I will get a college to study but will the VO accept such a transition?


What should I tell the VO if they ask me your course is not related to your job experience? Some VOs might directly give me a 214b after realising the experience and program are different.

My epilepsy isn’t really serious, but I would like to be able to get the medicine here instead of having my parents send it to me with my aunt because it’s late sometimes and then I have a seizure. Last time someone called an ambulance and I woke up and asked to leave immediately. They wanted to do blood tests but I refused and kept asking to leave. They sent my parents a bill of 3600$ which is crazy. Then I had to go to an urgent care and pay another 250 to see a doctor(which may or not prescribe me the medicine)  so I just want to be safe. I’m 24 by the end of the month.  What prices am I looking at per month? What is good? I called some companies and they said they don’t do it for F1 students. The one that did said it was 500$ / month- is this an average rate?

__________________________________________________

Main takeaway: 

Even though I was tensed and thought of pulling my hair out, I did not show anything on my face. I kept a calm manner, spoke clearly with confidence. They did not ask for any documents except passport and I-20. It was better knowing that I had everything in order so it gave a boost of confidence.

Dress in a comfortable formals. I know people say it's not that important, but it gives you a confidence boost for sure. Don't bring cell phones or bags with you. If you can, leave it with the person accompanying you or leave it at some place safe. There are quite a few scammers around the consulate so definitely be mindful.

Don't worry, you will do fine. Prepare well, don't be nervous. All the best!"

1. DS-160 Confirmation Page
2. Current and prior passport containing your previous visa
3. One photo size 5x5 cm taken within the last 6 months, please see this link for [**photo requirements**](https://www.ustraveldocs.com/my/my-niv-photoinfo.asp)
4. Interview Waiver confirmation letter
5. MRV fee payment receipt
6. An approved Form I-20or DS-2019 from your U.S. school or program
7. A Form I-901 SEVIS fee receipt indicating the SEVIS fee has been paid
8. Clear photocopy of marriage certificate for any spouse applying in a dependent visa category
9. Clear photocopy of birth certificate (for applicants below 18 years old)

I feel like the list above lacks supporting documents e.g., employment proof/offer letter, EAD card(s), financial docs, proof of ties to home country. **Should I include additional documents?**

**Also an additional Q:** Can I use the same photo I used for my STEM-OPT application? It still is within the 6 months criteria, or should I take a new one?

Would really appreciate any insights to from anyone who has gone through this process and/or recommendation on whether I should following the list above strictly.

TIA!

Since I will be on z-status during my final semester, I think it will be a good practical training through the internship.

How can I convince them to grant me the CPT for fall. They had also mentioned that they have agreed to give me post-graduation opt. My question here is, can a university refuse cpt/opt to a student?"
t3_wfmxl5,3,STEM OPT Employment Update Overdue (10 day requirement),2022-08-04 00:34:21,"Hello all. I’m nearing the end of my STEM OPT. I’ve been with the same employer with the same job duties and team for the last 2 years. I knew that STEM OPT had reporting requirements on changes in employment or personal info; but for some reason, I thought this reporting was required only for major changes like changing employers or moving. My mental energy has been consumed by preparing my GC app for the past 2 years; and to my fault, I overlooked this.

I realized today that I had a few minor employment changes from more than 10 days ago that I never reported. The physical location of my employment changed from 1 building to the building right next door. I also had my direct manager change twice throughout the last 2 years (I reported the first change on SEVP several months after it happened, reported the second change today). A few months ago, I got promoted and saw a significant pay increase; never reported this either.

Today, I submitted an updated i-983 without telling my DSO when exactly each change took place. Unless they talk to my employer specifically, I don’t think there’s any way for them to find out that I was overdue on reporting these changes.

Do you think I’d get in trouble for this? 

My combo card based on pending GC got approved today and I’ll be abandoning my F-1 once my STEM OPT expires in a few weeks."

Jun 18th - Received i20

Jun 19th - Booked a slot for jul 26th, the earliest available date in chennai for dropbox appointment

Jun 22nd - Changed slot to July 12th in Hyderabad as I learnt we can submit documents at any location

July 12th - Went to Chennai and submitted my documents (i20, passport, appointment letter, ds 160 confirmation, 1 us visa standard photo)

July 13th - Status updated in CEAC portal as application received only when chennai is selected. Selecting hyderabad showed no status.

July 19th - Status is now not available when selecting chennai but show application received when selecting Hyderabad

July 25th - Status updated but again says application received, just the update date changed

July 26th - Status changed to administrative processing

July 27th - Status changed to Issued 

July 29th - Passport reached my local city but I didn't collect because I was out of station

Aug 3rd - Paid 650 and collected passport, had the i20 form and passport inside the envelope.

Just to give everyone my timeline so they can keep track of their process too. I felt it was a very chill process, just took longer than an interview. I would totally recommend this though as it's way more peaceful in terms of slot availability. Good luck everyone!"

My questions are :

1) Is it okay to setup my business as sole proprietorship?

&gt;Self-employed business owner : You may start a business and be self-employed. You should be able to prove that you have the proper business licenses and are actively engaged in a business related to your degree program.

2) What is the best way to document my working hours to prove that I'm actively engaged and work full time on my business? Just in case I need to show a proof to USCIS / SEVP.

3) What information to give to my DSO about my self-employment? Name of business, start &amp; end working date, working hours, etc? Do I need to give a copy of my business license and other legal documents (DBA, seller's permit, etc)?"

Basically, the VO asked me the typical questions such as why do you want to go to the US? How will you fund your studies? my current company and my role, why did I choose this university ..etc. 

She told me at the end that ""Everything looks good"" with a smile. However, she continued ""but I will need you to fill out the form I am going to send you this after noon"". Also, she gave me the 221g paper and checked all the marks under additional required documents saying "" if you feel that anything doesn't apply to you just ignore it"".

One of the documents is called ""Proposed research or work plans, including a statement of purpose"". Given that I don't have detailed research plans yet as I will first do my masters . Which is better, ignoring this check and send other documents or sending the statement of purpose that I wrote the university while applying?  If the latter,  Should I modify it in anyway given the destination is different? what should I say? 

Another issue is in ""Letter from your employer explaining your position"". I really don't want to spread my traveling plans in my company before getting my Visa approved.  Could ignoring this check delay the processing further or even causing a rejection at the end? 

Finally, the University tells me that if I can't attend the next fall, I will lose my admission and I will need to re-apply as I deferred my admission for 1 year so far ( I got Visa denial last year).  Is it a good idea to send my documents with the university reply so that they speed up the process? Is there a good way to say it?

Now those two are gone and instead I have a section called ""special programs"" and it just says ""no questions were asked"", and another section that says ""Edit the applicant and answer the scheduling condition questions.""

Does this mean that they've at least begun to process my application? Also, I don't get any option to provide scheduling info when editing, but does that section being added mean that they'll ask me in for an interview?

PS. applied for a visa at the US embassy in Spain

t3_wj6j5i,18,F-1 Visa Rejection - Suggestions To Improve,2022-08-08 11:31:21,"Hello guys,

I am an Indian and was recently rejected for my f1 visa interview under Section 214(b) and one of the reasons was probably because I was late to the interview which might have shown a lack of preparation from my side. Initially, I had reached the consulate on time but had forgotten to get a printout of my Sevis receipt so the staff told me to go and get it from outside (Just before meeting the visa officer). By the time I had returned they had gone for lunch and the staff told me to come back an hour later.

Can you guys help by suggesting what aspects of my application I can improve/fix other than the late part? Here is my recount of the interview:

Program: MS CS in University at Buffalo.

VO: Goodmorning! Namaste! How are you doing?

Me: Goodmorning Officer! I am good, How about you?

VO: (ignores) Please pass me your documents.

Me: Here they are.

VO: Your interview seemed to be a little earlier than this. What happened?

Me: I am really sorry officer, I had forgotten to get one of my documents and reached late.

VO: (after a small pause) So why are you going to the State University of New York at Buffalo?

Me: I am going to Buffalo because it aligns with my career interests of working in Applied Artificial Intelligence. It is one of the top ranked universities according to csrankings for the field of Artificial Intelligence and has a very high research output in it as well. I also have a cousin who is studying for another Nursing degree at Buffalo University and she has given me really good reviews on it.

VO: Ohh, you have family in the US? Do you have anybody else?

Me: Yes, I have another cousin as well but she is a student studying in San Diego.

VO: Where did you pursue your education before this?

Me: I pursued my Bachelor's in Computer Science at Christ University, Bangalore.

VO: Christ? Is it a Christian University? (looked at my Original Transcripts)

Me: Yes, it is. It is run by Catholic Fathers.

VO: Are you married?

Me: No, I am single.

VO: How are you going to fund your education?

Me: My parents are going to fund it.

VO: (cut me off) Ohh yeah, What do they do?

Me: They are involved in running a business which comprises of supplying Sports and Stationery goods across the city. They also have a retail store that sells these products as well as a variety of Children's toys. Their combined income is estimated to be around X USD (Was more than COA in I-20). They also have savings worth $45,000 USD (this is the estimated COA in I-20) solely for my education.

VO: (after typing for a while, also he barely looked at me and was typing the entire time) Please place 4 fingers of your left hand and press until you hear a beep.

Me: Yes, done.

VO: Please place both of your thumbs.

Me: Done

VO: (more typing ) You seem like a really smart guy but unfortunately, you do not qualify. Thank you! Namaste!

Me: I am sorry, could you please repeat that (I could not believe it)?

VO: You do not qualify for the visa! Please take your documents. Namaste!

Me: Thank You."

This is what the case status thing says.

Your visa case is currently undergoing necessary administrative processing. This processing can take several weeks. Please follow any instructions provided by the Consular Officer at the time of your interview. If further information is needed, you will be contacted.

Here's my story: 

Couple of weeks ago i got my F1 visa and the approved date on my visa is 26th July 2022. 

But the problem is i may want to defer to the next semester due to some personal issues is it possible to defer and enter US with same visa or do I need redo the visa again. Heard about 5 months rule(it's vague and doesn't specifies number of days, most Stuff i found was on students deferring after a semester or so ) but still confused about it 😓. So wanted to confirm. 

Timeline 

F1 approved: 26th July 2022. 

My university spring semester 2023 start date is: 23rd January 2023. As per 30 day rule i can enter US from 24th December 2022, just wondering can i enter or not into the US(in 2 days of window if I'm bound by 5 month's rule) or do i have to redo again. 

Thanks in advance y'all 😊."

Be great if y'all could help me out. (International student from India, planning for Spring 2023 intake, MSCS)

Questions :

1. Is there any way for the VO to know the number of universities you applied to? Also your rejections/admits? How does one tackle this question?
2. I've seen a few interview stories about people being rejected even after displaying adequate funds. Does it have to intuitively ""make sense"" to the VO, or as long as you have the documents with the funds you're good?
3. The proof of funds you use to receive your i20 from your uni, are those still valid for the Visa interview? Does the current balance on my account on the day of the interview matter? Or is the document enough?
4. Further how long back can a document be dated from your interview date to be accepted as a proof of funds?"

My colleague (kind of informal mentee) is a student here on a F1 with SEVIS record recently transferred to another school after graduating but not qualifying for OPT (there are some questionable things about this) but they cannot afford the new school. I have known them 2 years but only met in person once. I am encouraging them to go to their home country and said I could loan a small amount for them to travel there and live for a bit, but they say they can't and break down crying but don't explain further. They said they are not eligible for asylum. I also have reason to suspect they may have been lying to me about the OPT. But they have nobody supporting them and no funds left at all (zero). I've tried everything I can do short of giving them my savings to pay for a second master's degree all so they can get OPT at the end of it. I am at a loss for what to do. They are homeless waiting for me to do something. I have given them names of shelters, soup kitchens, legal aid, etc. I can't in good conscious leave them to become undocumented and homeless in the US, but I don't know what else to do.

- I currently live in Myanmar under a dictatorship. The US embassy had been closed for all visa applications since last december. They decided to open it on June 2nd and as expected tons of applicants run to apply for it. For that reason, we were not given a choice to make our appointment but to wait for their scheduled appointment. I submitted my interview request on May 26th ( when they announced they will start scheduling interviews on june 2nd) but I only received my appointment on 30th July which is very close to August 22nd, my school start date. I didn’t really expect to get into administrative processing because I am still a high school student. With no military background and so on. But here I am.

I interviewed on the 3rd of July at the consulate in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia after which I was told that my visa was **APPROVED** and I would receive my visa in a week's time. Immediately after the interview, my CEAC status showed ""**REFUSED""** and it shows the same status until now. My passport was returned 4 days after the interview and I was told to wait until the consulate contacted me. Later when I called the consulate, I was told that my case is under administrative processing (AP) and I am to wait until the consulate contacts me.

I haven't been asked to submit any additional documents for AP nor was I given a 221g slip or form. But upon calling the consulate, they tell me my visa is under AP and the same reflects in CEAC. My program start date is 29th August 2022.

&amp;#x200B;

1. For people who got AP, when did you get your 221g slip and/or form? Is it possible to be under AP without any additional documents being requested from you? Also, during AP, what did your CEAC status show, Refused or Administrative Processing? How long did it take to clear your visa?
2. Since I haven't been asked to send in any documents nor have I received any correspondence from the consulate, I am considering sending my passport back regardless. Does anyone have any advice on this?

As noted earlier, my i-20 is already registered, and I will be present in the United States at the time of my program start date(during which the TA training begins).

I filed for my OPT in April 2022 and I didn’t get a response from uscis until July. I opened the RFE and it said that “The Student and Exchange Visitor System (SEVIS) shows that you were terminated due to, student has not registered within 60 days after program start date. And that you were automatically terminated 90 days after next session started’’. This was really ridiculous because I literally graduated spring 2022. So I called my DSO and she said she ‘forgot’ to register me and that she has corrected it (after the RFE came in). 

The crazy thing is the amount of documentation I have to provide to show that I was physically present in school. I’ll list them below: 

This evidence must include but is not limited to:
1. A statement from the Designated School Official (DSO) and the Registrar attesting to your physical presence in the classroom;
2. A full description of your course of study/academic program, including all graduation requirements such as the number of credits or classroom hours and your college’s definition of “full course of study” for your degree level;
3. Copies of your course syllabi for all classes and coursework in which you earned credit towards your degree. Provide delivery method (in person/lecture, lab, virtual, online, tele-learning, broadcast, satellite, etc.) of the course if not listed on the syllabus;
4. Proof of tuition payments made by you for the duration of your enrollment;
5. A copy of your most recent transcripts showing number of credits or hours received.

This has been the hardest thing for me to process and I’m so sad. Please make sure you double check with your DSO about your F1 status. Just wanted to share :)

Also, I’ll appreciate credible advice on how to go about this issue"

1. What would be a reasonable timeline that I could expect for this process start-to-finish?
2. I'm aware that new F1 visa students are not allowed to enter the country before 30 days of their program start date. Since I'm already enrolled in a university and completed 3 years of study by the time I would have to get a F1 visa, would this also apply to me?

2. Would the overall processing be any longer for a noncitizen/nonimmigrant who applies from the US, compared to what it would be for others (i.e. should I ignore the processing time estimates on Canada's website)?
3. I'm a dual-citizen of two Latin American countries, and my F-1 visa stamp is (obviously) only in one of my passports. Can I -- and, if so, should I? -- use my other passport for the Canadian visa process, so that I can retain the ability to leave and re-enter the US during the Canadian visa application process? Or would they suspect that I'm in the US illegally if I turn in a passport without any US entry stamps or a US visa stamp?

Thanks a ton for your help."
t3_wqu00i,0,F1 visa renewal under administrative processing (no reason given),2022-08-17 16:52:56,"I have one semester left of my undergrad, although it is an extra (i.e., 9th) semester because I was behind on my graduation requirement (and one of my majors) by one course. My visa expired in late July and I also really wanted to do OPT after my final semester, so I travelled to my home country to renew my visa. 3 weeks after submitting all of my documents (interview waived), I had still not heard back, so I submitted an inquiry and that was how I found out my application was ""refused for administrative processing"" but no reason or any other detail was provided. 

I just cannot think of any reason why this was not an easy instant approval, and was also wondering 

1. how common AP for F1 visa renewals is,
2. how long this is likely to take,
3. and what the odds are for an approval/denial.

**Some details of my situation:** I started my undergrad in 2017 but had to take two semesters off (non-consecutively) due to circumstances related to the pandemic, and also had to withdraw from a few classes which ultimately led to falling short by one class. There was no way I could've handled an additional course to my normal courseload (I struggled even with a regular courseload in covid/""post""-covid conditions), and I couldn't have taken it over the summer because the programme end date for F1 students has to be the end of a regular semester session. I also \*really\* wanted to do OPT -- any experience I may get in a year in the US would be so valuable for me in terms of my future career/grad school plans (clinical psychology). So I thought renewing my visa would be a good idea!

I have no immediate or close relatives in the U.S. -- my entire life is in my home country. My majors are psychology and philosophy, I have maintained good academic and social standing throughout my time here, filed taxes, etc. Is there anything about the situation I detailed above that would raise any red flags to prompt AP? 

Classes start on Aug 22nd and I am very stressed that the AP won't be completed in time (or it won't even be approved in the end) and the latest I can arrive in the U.S. is by Sept 1st or 2nd. All thoughts/advice/prayers would be appreciated."

The visa status had always been ""Refused"" and today it changed to ""Administrative Processing"".

I have no idea why they did not simply take the passport, and ask me to submit ds5535, why going an extra mile to submit the passport?

* Tell me about your education background?

Gave a brief intro of my studies and my work experience in India

* You have a masters then why masters again?

Gave a short answer to upgrade my skills and ended with plan to return back to home country after completion of the course

* I see you got f2 visa last year and you said that your stay for 3 weeks, but you stayed for 7 months?

Told her i was newly married and stayed with my spouse and talked about the university i applied in little more detail.

* Who will be sponsoring your education?

Mentioned my spouse would sponsor for my studies with savings $XXX and received scholarship of $XXX

* Where does your spouse work?

Mentioned that spouse is working in the US and profile and company name. FYI only , i did not mention this to VO officer (Spouse currently under f1 opt and under change of status to h1b from Oct 1 2022) Could this be a reason for rejection ?

In the end she mentioned that sorry at this point of time i will not be able to issue you the visa and handed me over a 214b slip along with my passport and documents and I also feel that the reason of rejection is since i stayed for 7 months instead of 3 weeks (although I did visit India for 1 month in April to attend a marriage and I was in legal f2 status in the US).

So my hopes and dreams may have just gone up in smoke because I don't have a cosigner.

The interview was last week and the consular officer refused my application once again and handed me a green slip of paper instructing me to send a whole bunch of additional documents (like a resume, a letter of invitation, etc.) to them via email. I had brought most of the additional documents to the interview, however, he didn’t even want to see them when I pointed out that I had them with me. 

Now, after emailing the documents, I got an (it seems) automated reply saying that “the Department completes the required administrative processing within six months of receiving this email” and that they’re “unable to expedite the administrative processing”.

Sure, you can make judgements based on my name and how I look, but on paper, I guess I’m as German as any “German”. During my interview, however, the officer almost asked me more questions about China than the US (like: When was the last time you visited China? What did you do? Do you have relatives in China? Are your parents Chinese citizens? Do you still have Chinese citizenship?). It somehow makes me feel like I was rejected because of my Chinese ancestry which, well, I can’t do anything about.)"
t3_wsusa3,0,F-1 Renewal on OPT. Interested in pursuing a higher degree soon.,2022-08-20 01:31:51,"Hello Everyone!

My parents have been in Saudi Arabia for the past 25 years, and I have spent all my time there, although I am an Indian passport holder. I came to the US in 2016 for my undergrad. I transitioned to my master's, graduated in 2022, and am currently on Post-Completion OPT. During my master's, I realized I want to pursue a Ph.D. My advisor and other professors recommended that I get some industrial experience to understand the research space and also the issue that they didn't have the funds to sponsor a Ph.D. student due to COVID reasons. Hence, depending on further discussions with my advisor and other professors elsewhere, I plan to apply for a Ph.D. in Fall 2023 or 2024.

My F-1 visa expired in 2021, and I plan to travel to Saudi Arabia this December for an F-1 renewal. If the interviewer asks about my plan post-OPT, would stating the intention to transition to a Ph.D. program shortly be a valid reason? Or should I state that I plan to come back after my OPT period has ended (I do plan on coming home as staying away from family for almost three years has drained me unless I get to follow my passion (Ph.D.))? I would also like to understand how risky it is to get a renewal on my OPT status.

My interview was for &gt;20 minutes, probably because they were verifying my profile with scrutiny.

To the people who think VOs only reject visas(s), let me tell you something which I noticed meticulously - Some VOs in Indian Consulates(US EMBASSIES) are rejecting blatantly within 10 seconds, irrespective of the student's profile. While, there are other VOs who are looking for a reason to approve your visa. Now, the good VO who wants to give you visa is finding more and more reasons to reject your visa because of your poor performance in the interview. He starts rejecting everyone else's Visas too.
So its my kind request to all the people living in India or any other non-native English speaking community to kindly focus on how to present your answers properly without fumbling, with confidence. If you suck at English, brush up your speaking skills because most of the people go blank in interviews after VO asks very simple question!


VO and the student need to find some common ground to get your visa approved. That, is so called LUCK.

Do not blame VOs for rejection."

I was in hurry so I didn't have the chance to check my answers. 

One question I'm concerned about is the Legal name of my siblings. In fact, I have half-brothers and half-sisters that I know nothing about.

I mentioned the same comment when I filled the DS-5535 (that I can't confirm their legal names).

Can I be rejected because of it?

Can I submit a revised/ modified answers if I could get their names?

On the interview the interviewer asked if I had been to the US before as well as where we stayed, whether I attended school there. I said I didn’t attend any schools there. For where we stayed I told him we stayed at a hotel but we were renting an apartment. The interviewer asked if I have any relatives in the US. I said no.

Now, following the 60 day rule, basically when applying for OPT and choosing a start date, the start date can’t be later than 60 days after official graduation date, which in this case is May 15th, so my latest opt start date would be July 15th. 

I guess my question is :

Does 60 day rule means that USCIS has to receive the application within 60 days of graduation and the start date can be later than that? Or they have to receive the application within those 60 days and the start date also has to be within those 60 days?

Let’s say i apply within those 60 days and my start date on opt application is July 15th, but my actual starting work day is September 15th, would that count towards my 90 days unemployment days?

EDIT: Finally after 50 days USCIS decided to confirm my status and hopefully I can continue with my DL application. Big thanks to everyone answering / sharing ideas"

I am on a co-op right now which ends in December 2021. I am left with 3 courses. I have taken 1 course in fall to go along with my co-op. If I do that, Ill be left with 2 courses in Spring and will graduate in May 2023. Half of my friends are doing the same and the other half are not taking any course this year.

I am asking in terms of Full Time jobs, due to the ongoing recession, people decided not to register for a course this year and graduate late, by taking 2 courses in spring and probably one Summer1/Summer2/Full summer course. It buys them extra time to search for a full-time job

t3_wuy2w2,5,help: Consular appt. person confused about renewing F-1 visa while on STEM OPT,2022-08-22 16:24:28,"So I am on STEM OPT and today I attended my consular appointment to renew F-1 visa so I can travel back and forth home in the future. The person at the front desk to whom I had to hand over the original documents (didn't look like an officer) was asking for ""the most recent I-20"" even though the one I provided is the most recent one, issued only a month ago by my school, specifically for the purposes of renewing the visa. They did see the STEM OPT reccomentation in the back, yet they pointed out how the ""program end date"" is in the past. Now, I know that, and the whole purpose of STEM OPT is that it is issued based on a completed degree, so of course, the program end date will be in the past. I politely, while shocked and confused about what's the problem, managed to utter 2 sentences to say that this is the most recent I-20, issued a month ago, and the STEM OPT is issued based on the listed degree.

The person still acted confused and even annoyed, and they basically hinted to me to leave and that they'll contact me if they need more information. Frankly, I was too shocked to speak or try to clarify or remedy the situation like I normally would, so I dropped off the documents listed on the checklist (which didn't include STEM OPT card or employer letter) and left so I can safely cry in a corner while questioning my understanding of reality, metaphorically speaking.

Has anyone around here renewed F-1 visa while on STEM OPT? Did you have any issues? Am I missing something?

I expected this to be a super smooth process for me and was feeling pretty confident about this whole thing, but today's experience caught me off guard, so now I'm anxious and worried about my upcoming flights and the job I need to get back to in the US."

t3_wvnln5,4,F1 visa renewal while on post completion OPT. Dropbox experience,2022-08-23 12:31:29,"While there is so little information on this topic on the internet and forums in general that I thought I add my experience hoping to help someone navigating through the same pains. Before I start let me give you some context. I graduated with a PhD in December 2021, and have been working on post completion OPT for a few months now. I haven't been to India (home) in a while (thanks to we all know). To add to the misery, my F1 visa expired in June 2020, and I had no idea what the situation was regarding visa renewals.

By the beginning of the summer, I thought of giving it a shot and started collecting information on how the process looks like. Since post completion opt comes under the category of F1 visa, the process is exactly the same as for someone who is applying for F1 visa for the first time.

The process looks like this:

Let's start with the pre appointments details

1. You start with filling out the DS160 on this website ([https://ceac.state.gov/genniv/](https://ceac.state.gov/genniv/)).
2. Once you have filled out the form, you will look for the appointments for dropbox on this website [https://cgifederal.secure.force.com/](https://cgifederal.secure.force.com/). Most likely you would have forgotten the password but it's easy to recover that. You will have the option of choosing dropbox if you already have a US visa. This will most likely be true if you are on OPT (or any other type of visa for that matter).
3. You need to fill out the new application for the appointment and choose the date. There will be a bunch of questions that you need to answer either yes/no which will determine if you are eligible for a dropbox appointment. Once you are done filling the application and paying the application fees, it will provide you the available appointments.
4. Now here is the caveat, after listening to all the horror H1b stories I knew I had no chance of getting an appointment but to my surprise the appointments for F1 dropbox are available in plenty even if you need a week from now. It took me a few seconds to book the appointment.
5. The documents you would need to have at the time of appointment are: **DS160 confirmation page, appointment confirmation page, I20 (6 months signature), 1 photo**: please be very careful with this, a lot of people were sent back because of wrong photo specs but again they would give you the end of the day to come back and submit if you have missed anything. Nothing more, nothing less.
6. Some points to remember; even if you make a mistake on your DS160, don't panic. It's totally okay to fill out a new form and take a print out of it on the day of your appointment and submit it with your documents. Just let them know that you had made a mistake in your submitted DS160.

Day of appointment:

1. I had my appointment at the Delhi VAC which is next to Shivaji metro station. My appointment was on Wednesday at 1:15 PM but I went there at 10 AM. They will ask you the appointment time and chances are they will ask you to come back 20 mins before the actual time. You can always lie to them which is what I did. I told them that my appointment was at 1030. They won't check your confirmation page.
2. Once you are in, you can go to the counter and submit the documents. Since the person who was collecting the document did not know about post completion OPT, she had to go back and check with her senior officials. Don't hesitate to explain your position if they don't have any information on it.
3. I did not see any update on my application before Monday (you can check the status here: [https://ceac.state.gov/ceacstattracker/status.aspx](https://ceac.state.gov/ceacstattracker/status.aspx)).
4. On Monday, my application status changed from ""no status"" to ""application received"" and also had a note to check back in 2 business days for a decision on my application. On Tuesday, my visa got approved. I haven't received my passport yet, so I am not sure about the duration of the visa.

I had a lot of anxiety throughout the whole process but it was pretty straight forward. I had all the worst scenarios in my head just in case I had to stay here for a few months.

Please feel free to DM me. I know it can be extremely challenging to go through this!

PLEASE PLEASE go ahead and book your appointments, I was too scared since it's recommended not to go back when you are on OPT. Amongst my friends, I have not heard a single case of rejection and that's the same thing that the DSO told me as well but again that's a very small sample size."

t3_wxiswk,1,Interning within the UN on OPT and remote - Right of reentry with F1 visa,2022-08-25 16:32:59,"Hi all,

I have several questions and I am wondering whether anybody that comes across this sub may have answers as they are very very specific....

I am currently on OPT since June 29th 2022  and finished a first internship on from July 1st to August 15th.

 I left the country a bit earlier on August 8th to visit family in France and spend some time there. Recently I was offered another internship but this time with the United Nations Development Program and started working remotely on August 22nd.

Because the internship is not paid a lot and I want to stay close to my family for the moment, I'd like to go back to the US to pursue the internship in person but only at a later point around October or November.

1) Is my time outside of the US counted towards the 90 days unemployment limit for OPT although I am currently working remotely?

2) (this question is very specific but the UN HR did not provide any answers to me yet so if any UN intern sees this let me know) Am I allowed to come back to the US on OPT with an F1 visa to intern for the UN with a valid EAD? Should I still get a G visa?

Thanks a ton"

t3_wyfmfv,10,Dropping out of PhD program,2022-08-26 17:50:56,"I have a specific question regarding student (F-1 visa) situation. I am a PhD student in US on my F-1 visa. While I was working on a internship in summer, I was offered a full-time position from the company. I am considering of dropping out of my PhD program and considering the offer.  

Having said that, my concern is work authorization. I have completed my Masters from US on F-1 visa and have utilized about 8 months of my OPT period. If I plan to drop out of PhD program and want to work on a full-time position, what options do I have for work authorization? Can I use the remaining period of my previous OPT towards this job?

I am aware that people drop out of their PhD or Masters program and work in US, but I am not sure on what visa situation are they permitted to work.

Any help or suggestion would be appreciated."
t3_wyn181,7,Is my F-1 status in question?,2022-08-26 23:07:22,"Hi, I finished my OPT period sometime last year. I'm now trying to return to the US on a different visa (my interview is scheduled in the next few weeks) and I'm nervous as to whether the following two situations will show up as flags/violations in the system during my interview.

Situation 1: I worked 40 hours for an on-campus job during spring break while I was still in school. I know that working 40 hours during breaks is allowed, but here's the catch - the payroll for that university counts Thursday to Wednesday as the pay week. So my spring break 40 hour work-week got split into two. To complicate this further, I worked 20 hours in the week before (Thursday &amp; Friday), and 20 hours on the week after (Monday &amp; Tuesday). And now I have two paychecks with 40 hours on them. Is this going to be a problem?

Situation 2: A few weeks before the end of my OPT period, a girl I was seeing at the time and I had the chance to be background characters for a music video. At the time, I understood this to be just something we did for fun and to create some memories before we parted ways. However, at the end of the shooting period we both got $50 checks. I cashed the check, but also left the $50 as a tip at my favorite restaurant. So I didn't have any net gain out of this experience.

Are any of these situations violations of my F-1 status? And if yes, do you think this is something that could be forgiven by a sympathetic consular/CBP officer? Please let me know. I'm driving myself crazy just thinking about this."

Long story short... I applied for a 24-month STEM OPT extension on the date at which my initial OPT EAD expires.

I entered the US with my parents at the age of 16 on a A-1 (diplomatic) visa. While in the US, I graduated high school and started college at the age of 18, by which point I had switched from A-1 to F-1. As I understand it, F-1 is exempt for up to 5 years from the substantial presence test for the purposes of being treated as a nonresident alien. However, do these 5 years include only my years in F-1, or would I also be forced to include my years as on A-1 visa where I was (underage) claimed as a dependent by my parents and did not earn income?

It seems reasonable that none of my years in A-1 status would count, since I was underage and did not earn any income. However, I'd like to somehow confirm this rather than rely on my own speculation."

I also went ahead and asked my friend how he went to the US and he said that he actually chose the 'Medical' option which I do not understand how he could as he would be there to study as a student.

VO - Why ABC? 

Me- My dad’s friend and his colleague are ex- military pilots and they went around the US looking for good flying schools and finally decided on this to send their children to. So I feel that this flying school would suit me best considering we know people who have trained there.

It doesn't really make sense since I think the laws applied on F-1 students are supposed to prevent them from displacing Americans. I know so many F-1 students who work remotely for their family businesses while in the US. I'm wondering if there's any laws that mention this at all? Am I really banned from interning remotely even if it's unpaid??? **I'm happy to request for an authorization if needed but the problem is that there's no such kind of work authorization.**

I'm freaking out because I missed submitting a STEM OPT 12 month report last year, and I'm thinking they terminated my account?

It is completely voluntary, even for working professionals from MAANG companies who contribute there, and there is no compensation or contracts. There is a volunteer sign-up process and a background check done by the county public school system though. 

I spoke to the regional manager and he said that there shouldn't be any problems with my immigration status. The DHS website also [says that volunteering is allowed](https://studyinthestates.dhs.gov/2013/12/volunteering-united-states), and so does the ISSS sites of other universities.

t3_x4nu40,9,Automatic Visa Revalidation Experience (Air + Land),2022-09-03 06:48:03,"I used AVR to enter the US from Canada twice, once by air and once by land, since my F1 visa had expired, and thought I could share my experience since it was hard to find specifics online (I managed to dig up some of the more helpful advice on some Chinese forum).

Entry using AVR by air: I had a flight with American Airlines from Quebec City to LA with a transfer in Philadelphia. Several things to note: 

* I have received advice that it is recommended to **book with an American airline** if you are going to use your AVR, because most of the time, the agent at the check-in table will have a hard time trying to bypass the system to issue you a boarding pass if your US visa is expired, and they will have to call their airline hotline to ask, and in my case, the airline hotline had to call CBP to verify, and I presume it is easier for an American airline to contact CBP.
* Fly from an airport with **CBP pre-clearance** ([https://www.cbp.gov/travel/preclearance](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/preclearance)), because the staff there supposedly will be more familiar with the rules and will be able to streamline the process. Where I flew from (YQB) does not have CBP pre-clearance and it was their first time hearing of AVR.
* Arrive **before check-in opens** for your flight.
* My experience: I could not check in online due to my expired visa, so I arrived at YQB 5 hours before my departure, explained the situation to the agent at the check-in counter, who was perfectly willing to help, but told me to come back 2 hours before the flight time because only then was the check-in for my flight online for them to print my boarding pass. 
   * I arrived on time and had to wait in line for 15 minutes before my turn, which left me ONE hour for them to figure out how to print my boarding pass. This is the biggest mistake because I could have gained 25 more minutes, which is nearly 50% more time if I had arrived 10 minutes earlier.
   * While the agent was willing to let me through, they could not figure out how to print the boarding pass with an expired visa number, so they fumbled for 10 minutes and had to call their superior over. I explained the situation again to the boss, and the boss stood there for 10 minutes trying to help her how to bypass the system but failed, so they had to call the American Airlines *hotline*, which took 20 minutes before it went through (possibly because this was in late June when travel was crazy). The American Airline agent on the other side was also apparently unfamiliar with the process, as both of them had to go through my I-20 line by line, starting from ""Department of Homeland Security"". The American Airline agent then had to connect to a CBP officer before verifying that I can *in fact* enter.
   * After everything, they only had 5 minutes to figure out how to bypass the system and print my boarding pass, which of course they could not, but since the ""superior"" fortunately had the authority, they could allow some more time, so I finally got my boarding pass 30 minutes before departure and got expedited through all the security checks.
   * Entry to the States from PHL was extremely smooth. They took a brief look at my I-20 to enter my SEVIS number and asked where I was heading to.
* What I would have done differently: When approaching the agent for the first time, I would explain to them that this would require them to bypass the boarding pass printing process and ask if they have ever done that before. If not, if I speak to their ""manager"" and if their ""manager"" also does not know how to print a boarding pass for an expired visa number, they would have ample time to figure that out with the airline. *It's only a matter of time.*

Entry using AVR by land: I was traveling from Vancouver by the Amtrak bus, and I was mentally prepared for a very long check at the border, but the officer took a look at my I-20, asked what I did in Vancouver, where I was residing in the States, entered my information and waved me through. The process took less than 5 minutes.

Since I'm living close to the border, after those two experiences, I have started planning my travels so that I would cross the border to Vancouver and travel domestically within Canada and vice versa, since the large Canadian airports with CBP pre-clearance are not exactly known for their efficiency.

I hope my sharing could be helpful to some, and I would appreciate additional tips to lessen the anxiety of travelling on AVR 🥂"
t3_x4riri,4,Question about automatic revalidation,2022-09-03 10:49:30,"My F1 expires in November and I was planning on visiting home (Europe) in December. My idea was to fly through Canada and get my visa renewed automatically there. However the website [is a little ambiguous](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/visa-information-resources/visa-expiration-date/auto-revalidate.html): it says that visa holders need to apply for a new visa ii they ""traveled to a country other than Canada, Mexico, or an adjacent island which is not included in the automatic revalidation provisions"".

Expected wait times?,2022-09-07 11:15:30,"I’m in a bit of a tricky situation where my US visa (F-1 on STEM OPT) expires in 3 months but I won’t have time to go back to my home country for maybe another year due to distance + remote work constraints. I have a Canadian tourist visa that expires in 4 months that I was thinking of leveraging by traveling to canada for an interview (if needed?) and waiting there while my visa is processed, even if it ends up going past my US visa expiration date. I can also travel to Mexico for renewal prior to the expiration of my US visa (but won’t be able to stay there once US visa expires?)

My question is:

 1. would either of those countries and any specific embassies within have significantly shorter processing times? Also is there any way I can find out wait times for appointments before paying the visa fee (which would lock me to the embassy the fee is paid for right?)

 2. Any chance Canadian embassies are still doing mail-in apps without interviews (they were up until last summer). 

3. Should I hold off submitting an O-1 visa app in the meantime as that might indicate immigration intent?

EDIT: I might have a couple of conferences to attend in the first half of next year before I can make it home so I’m thinking that if I were to renew before then the next 2-3 months is all I got.

Does one needs to report a change of address while on pre-completion OPT through AR11 form or school handles it as long as one renews their address change within the school-internal system? For a reference, the change of address happened exactly on the day the EAD card arrived through the mail.

- what did you study
- where will you work (role &amp; company &amp; location)
- what will you do after OPT ends

I'm a continuing PhD student and I came back to India to renew my visa. First, I went through Dropbox, but I was called in for an Interview.

I had my interview on August 17th at Mumbai, where I was given a 221g Blue slip which I assume is TAL related. Here's my timeline:

Visa Interview: 17th August, Blue slip 221g

Documents submitted: 19th August

Passport requested for final processing: 9th September

Status changed to Administrative processing: 12th September

Status changed back to Refused: 14th September (Refused with the long text underneath)

This has got me worried. Why did it change back to Refused when I received an email saying that the Admistrative processing was over and I was requested to submit my passport for final processing. 

Please let me know if you have any such experiences! Anything helps, thank you.

Long story short, I got undergrad degree in USA under a visa that is not F-1. I got into a PhD program last year, and deferred a semester. I have my visa interview this month. My status I had in undergrad is not important information because it was legal and should not impact my case. I just shared it so no one is confused

My information:

1. Ph.D. in Material science
2. BS in Natural Science (Final GPA: 3.5/4.0)
3. Fully funded (TAship/ RA ship)- covers tuition, stipends, and insurance
4. Also have about 50K$ in US bank account
5. No criminal record (I did get pulled over for going over the speed limit once in America tho..)
6. Parents are in America with a non-immigrant visa, and they have stayed for 12 years. (Same visa all throughout). I will be living 15h away from them, but they both have companies and will be funding me (if needed)

I have spoke to enough people to know that number 6 is a huge red flag, as this might show that I may not return to my home country. What do you guys think? What can i do to minimize my chances for denial?"

t3_xgu34i,6,Remote Classes Until Administrative Processing Gets Completed,2022-09-17 18:35:54,"Hello, I applied for an F-1 visa at the end of June. Due to a significant backlog of admin processing in my country for F-1 visa, my visa has been delayed. My classes started from end of August, and until now (the add drop period) the university has allowed me to attend remotely. 

But since the end of add drop period is here, my school is allowing to attend classes until my visa gets issued, whenever that might be in Fall 22. Therefore, my question is related to how can I update my I-20 to conform with this accommodation that they are giving me (strictly from an immigration perspective). From my research, initial students are not allowed to enter if the course they are enrolled in is fully online. And to be clear, my course is not online at all except a few courses. Its just that the university is kind enough to make this arrangement for me (and a few others who get sick throughout the semester due to COVID) with the consent of the professors. So does this make it a hybrid program for me? If it makes any difference, this is a masters level program at a T-10 university.

I’m currently in a very confusing situation with the personnel at my university, I really want to know your opinion before I reach the DSO cause I think the treatment I’m receiving is kind of insulting.

I recently got a full-time job with the federal government, I’m also working as a Teaching Assistant at my university and only finishing thesis. I wanted to quit my job as a TA even though I only have to teach 4 hours a week, the money I receive from that is not worth my time. My current advisor told me not to quit and help them out with classes until the end of the semester so they don’t have to assign my hours to someone else. Only because I really appreciate him and the other TA’s, I decided to help and teach during the late afternoon, besides, it doesn’t interfere with my main job at all. My advisor had to give notice to his supervisors (bureaucracy 🙄) about this and the response has been very weird.
First they were inquiring about my visa status and asking if I was allowed to have a job outside school, which I don’t think those are proper questions from a science department. I just provided all my OPT documents from the DSO, as well as my EAD and visa. That wasn’t enough for them, so now they want a letter from my main job saying that they allow me to go and teach during my FREE TIME. Of course, my other job refused since they’ve said that whatever I decide to do with my free time is none of their business, and now I’m having problems because I don’t have (and I don’t want) to give that letter. 

I feel this is insulting since they’ve told me not to quit and help them out, I really want to know if you’ve faced a similar situation or is there some law that can protect me from this.

I know that as an F1 student I'm not allowed to work unless approved by my university. I have a bit of a dumb concern regarding taxes in my home country (Mexico). In my country I have the option to continue reporting to the tax authority or suspend activities if I don't have any. I have an accountant in Mexico that has been helping me with my taxes for a few years and they advised me not to suspend activities while in the US and simply claim I have no income in my yearly tax return there.  However, I'm a bit concerned this could be seen as me trying to work from Mexico while in the US as I will continue doing taxes in my country. I would definitely not be working so I would not have any income in Mexico. I do have a scholarship and allowance given by my university in the US, but I was told I don't have to pay taxes in my country for this as this will go directly to my US bank account.

I guess my question is if I continue paying taxes in my home country, could this be seen as a red flag? Should I just file to suspend activities there or is reporting I have no income on my yearly tax return proof enough of me not working? In the case I go back to my country during break and do some work there, would this be allowed and would it be okay for me add that income to my tax return in Mexico?

I'm not sure if this is the best place to ask, but I hope some of you can help or give me some advice."

I feel I'm very bad luck in my SEVP Portal experience. I encountered several times that I was not able to update my employer addresses. It's okay that I always asked my DSO to help me change it backstage. But this time I encountered a new glitch and it blew my mind. My OPT start date is 3/21/2022. I updated my first job on the same date without any troubles. But recently I logged in to my account and was about to update a new job. I saw my first job's start date was changed to 3/20/2022. Then the system got stuck and it kept popping up a warning on the top of the page, ""Previously provided employer information from SEVIS is not complete. All required fields must be provided before saving"". So I was not able to save my new job's information. 

Of course, I cannot correct the date of my first job since it has already passed ten days. I asked my DSO to change it correctly and she did it for me. But now I'm logging in to my account and see that my first job's date was changed to the day before my OPT start date AGAIN for no reason. My DSO has no idea as well.

I am an international exchange student from UK and I am studying in the USA rn on an F1 visa. Yes, I know that usually exchange visitors are given J1, but idk why but my University gave us an F1.

As my major is not any specific degree, my University says they cannot file for OPT/CPT. What can I do about this to help make my case and obtain OPT status? Would it be possible to have a letter saying that due to my exchange nature I have a general studies major, but otherwise I am a CS student and apply?

I started working remotely for UNDP as an intern from abroad but I still have my OPT active, it's directly related to my field of studies and I have my EAD, hence I would like to come to the US to finish the internship in person.

However I have read that you may still have to change to G4 visa.

For example here is an internship posting that mentions: ""If the applicant is in F-1 status and has a valid EAD, they may undertake an internship within the scope of their F-1 visa without seeking a change of visa status. Please note, however, that interns in F-1 status who wish to undertake an internship following completion of their academic programme as part of Optional Practical Training (OPT) ‘may’ need to seek a change of visa status to G-4 (This process currently takes about 8-10 weeks) or obtain G-4 visa overseas.""

Has anyone ever interned to the UN on OPT?

 I have asked the UN but they have not clarified it yet. I don't want to be rejected at the border with the wrong visa.

t3_xk3mul,3,F1 Visa After L1B Rejection,2022-09-21 12:32:18,"I am currently working at a software company and planning to apply for an MS program in US (Fall 23) . My employer is offering me a chance to go to the US through an L1B visa, which will allow me to work and enroll in a part-time MS course simultaneously, should I wish to do so.

I am really willing to take this route but because I have approximately 3 years of work experience, they have certain doubts regarding the chances of visa approval (70-80% chance of approval), but willing to give it a try regardless.

Will I be eligible for an F1 visa next year (or in the near future) in case my L1B visa application gets rejected?"
t3_xk4uc6,4,Potential reasons of rejection,2022-09-21 13:23:53,"Hi, 

Turkish student here. I had my F-1 visa appointment at Istanbul Consulate for the MS in Computer Science at the Maharishi International University and I got rejected after roughly 1 min. of interview. I know MIU is not the best school out there but I think I could’ve explained myself a bit better. My interview went like this:

VO: Hi.

Me: Hello.

VO: Why do you want to come to U.S.?

Me: I want to study MS in CS at MIU.

VO: When did you graduate from undergrad?

Me: 2020.

VO: What have you been doing for the past two years?

Me: I have been working as a System Engineer in industry in Turkey.

VO: Why do you want to pursue masters ?

Me: I want to specialize in Software Engineering and the CS program at MIU offers a wide range of software engineering courses related to my areas of interest.

VO: Have you applied to any other school?

Me: Yes, I’ve applied to a school in Germany but got rejected.

VO: Unfortunately, you are not eligible…

The VO only looked at the I-20 and passport. I also make myself sponsor for my studies but I don’t know whether it greatly affects my chances of getting a visa. 

Should I take my chances again with the same profile for another appointment next week ? Did I make an obvious mistake that I should focus on ?"

Another option would be to withdraw from the fall quarter and join in the winter, however, if I do that my SEVIS and I-20 will be terminated (I'll have to get a new i-20 and SEVIS id) and my current visa application will be terminated and I’ll have to submit a new application and go for an interview again.

t3_xup6bg,4,Working for my current department post master's graduation on OPT?,2022-10-03 17:05:24,"The short version of the question I am wondering about is: What are the minimum requirements for working for my current department on OPT post graduation? What are some ground rules I should watch out for?

Of note: My degree is in biological sciences and I will be working on publishing a biology research paper for the biology department.


The longer version is:

I am currently a graduate research assistant in a lab at the bio-department with an accredited US university. I am defending my master’s thesis this October and graduating this fall. While I will complete my thesis soon enough, my PI and I want to see the manuscript published in a journal shortly (ideally in spring 2023). To do this, my staying in the US would be my preference. 

We would have continued my GRA position, but the department does not allow students who have already defended to be on assistant-ships. And paying out-of-state tuition would be cost-prohibitively expensive. But a research position that ticks all the boxes is perhaps going to be easier to manage financially. As such, we are wondering if the OPT route is possible.

If yes, where and how should we get started?

I prefer to physically be in the US for the time because:

1. I am planning to start a PHD in fall 2023 anyways and staying in the US physically is more convenient than moving back and forth halfway across the world twice in a 9 month period. 

2. Co-coordinating with colleagues on a research paper from a different time zone would be difficult given the 12 hour time difference.

3. I can get compensated for work here but the department cannot allocate funds if I am overseas

4. A very small possibility of it but I might get locked out of the US if another pandemic or whatever comes around again.

I have forwarded these questions to my DSO but I have had difficulty getting them to respond in a timely fashion in the past. 

Any help is greatly appreciated."

Situation: I finished my Master's in May 2022 and I joined a desi consultancy (an utterly brainless decision I admit). They filed for h1 under consular processing (which I suppose means that I can be on my OPT till I get it stamped from India) and the petition is approved now. I've been trying to find a contract since 5 months but with no luck. They've been running a fake payroll where I give back my salary in cash. Against all my instincts I thought I'll be able to fit in the environment and sell myself as a 5-6 year experienced professional (like they make you do it). Turns out I can't do it. I'm mentally exhausted, having destructive thoughts, have no source of income. I have no will to continue faking my experience, and even if I get a contract I don't know how I'll work as someone from whom so much will be expected. And when filing for h1 they made me sign a contract. There isn't a minimum term mentioned but there are damages mentioned if I decide to quit(which could be anywhere between 5-30k usd. Now my questions:

If I find a full time in Jan - feb and the company is willing to file a new petition for h1, how will the current employer be able to stop that process?

If I don't find a contract, should I let the current company revoke my approved h1 (since I'm technically on OPT)?

How much is the monetary damages if the current company decided to sue me, if I transferred to another company without letting them know?

Anyone with a similar situation in the past please message me. I came to the US with a lot of dreams and hopes. And I'm seeing my future being destroyed because of this decision I made.

I have a question about E verify and I hope I can find an answer here.

I’m on my first year OPT and employed but I’ve been looking for a new job in California.
I know that in order to get stem OPT approved the company has to have E verify.

This company that I really want to work for (only gone through the first round of interview) seemed pretty awesome and it’s a pretty decent sized company. It’s got over 23,000 employees and there are over 200 stores in CA and NV. Over the years they have acquired other small companies but they’re still 100% a family-owned company. I know I might not get the job, but just in case they do give me an offer, I want to know if I can take it.

I went to the E verify website and their name was not on the list 😢. I know it’s a completely voluntary thing but I don’t understand why a decent sized company does not have E verify. I also looked them up and found that they’ve sponsored H1B and green card before. It just seems odd to me! I don’t know what other names they could be under, maybe one of the companies they acquired in the past?

So how bad did I screw up? I scheduled a meeting with my DSO first thing Monday morning to sort this out; I'm just worried that this is irreversible :(

EDIT: Actually after reading through my school's website, it says I would only need to update the SEVP portal, so is my initial assumption correct? If not, where could this be coming from?

UPDATE: Whew, so my DSO checked my SEVIS record and this is due to my status being changed to H1-B, which I knew I got the approval for but not when it will come into effect.

A good friend of mine recently came from overseas via F1 study visa. To those not familiar: this visa allows you to attend U.S. university to study. However, you are not granted a social security number or official work authorization.  

The guy is a programmer and is studying for his database scientist master degree. He really wants to gain experience in the field, both to improve his English communication skills and to gain relevant experience in professional aspect. 

However, the F1 visa does not allow one to work, or attend internship outside of programs provided by his university. Absurd, I know, but it is what it is.

What advice can you give that may help him to overcome this obstacle? Can't a company vouch for him should he be hired? Does a person not have a right to work without jumping through bureaucratic hoops?

However, I’m a bit nervous about the process based on my immigration history.
1. I got my undergrad degree from a state school (summer 2019) and started working full-time on OPT for a year (OPT expired in summer 2020 and so did my undergrad F-1)

2. I enrolled in a Master’s program (summer 2020) and worked full-time with CPT throughout the program. The program qualifies for “day 1 CPT” if you will (graduated summer 2021)

3. I completed the program within one year and continued working with OPT and got my STEM OPT approved recently (summer 2022)

4. Throughout the years after my undergrad, I worked for the same company for a little over 3 years in total (well-known multi-national consulting/professional service firm)

If I go back to Japan, this would be the first time since 2019 when I graduated from undergrad and got my first EAD card from the undergrad OPT. 

I should also add that my employer has applied H1-B for me every year (they do automatically for everyone without a permanent status) but I’ve never won the lottery and there is no filing done in the past.

In addition, my mom recently moved to the US for her job under L-1 and her employer started her green card process but I do not appear on her application as I’m already 26. My dad still lives in Japan and my parents are separated. 

I’ve talked to my employer’s immigration lawyer and my school’s DSO, and although they mentioned there is always a risk, it should be low if I can demonstrate with honesty my intention to move back home at the end of my STEM OPT. 

Has anyone had any similar experience or have any advice? Appreciate your comments!

I'm in my final semester and on my full-time CPT for this semester as well. The place I'm doing my CPT internship wanted to make me a return offer.

So now I have two choices: do the ""bridging"" and stay at my current company; or take an offer from another company that is $20k lower than what I'm making at my current place. I've been looking up everywhere to see if ""bridging"" is a common rejection reason for H1B/GC but could not find any. Maybe my DSO was just being cautious? Also, I see just a few schools mention this on their website – probably only 3 or 4, including mine.

So my question is: should I take the risk for $20k more each year?

Edit: Link to a similar policy at the bottom of page 9 from another school since my school's document for this is not publicly accessible: [https://isss.utah.edu/forms-publications/documents/f1-cpt-policy-guide.pdf](https://isss.utah.edu/forms-publications/documents/f1-cpt-policy-guide.pdf)"

I am planning to travel for the holidays in December and return back to the US at the end of the month, which is about a month before my OPT EAD expires. I have a job and my visa is valid. I would apply for STEM OPT before I travel. But what if I get RFE or denial/rejection when I am abroad? Would I still be able to re-enter the US even if my OPT EAD will still be valid? If not, will I lose my job? I am wondering if it's worth the risk, and if anyone has been denied entry before when they were in a similar situation. "

I would love to apply to a Green Card through the EB3 VISA. 

I would like to do my process through consular process instead of doing it inside the US just because I think it’s taking longer with USCIS instead of the Embassy. 

So I am thinking about applying to Labor PERM &amp; i140 while I’m in the US and just go to my country for the VISA interview. 

I spoke to my attorney and he said that wouldn’t be a problem but I would like to know what you guys think or know if someone has a similar experience.

I have paid the visa fees and when I try to look for appointments, there are a lot of biometric slots that are open (Oct - Dec) for all the locations, but there’s none for the embassy interview. This is different from other visa categories where people are struggling to get even the biometric appointments. But if they do, they’re able to find a matching appointment for the embassy interviews.

Is anyone else facing the same? Do we have any updates about F2 visa slots getting opened in bulk in the near future if they’re not open for now?

During my F1, I got married to a US citizen and basically had to go through a lot of different steps to finally be able to file for adjustment of status/permanent residency. By the time I was able to file though, I was finishing up my dissertation and my international advisor said it would be best to file for OPT first as my EAD card will be granted much quicker that way. So I went ahead and did that but underestimated the job market. I am still applying for jobs and have 2 months left of my grace/unemployment period. I know I can technically volunteer to meet the requirements of OPT but if for some awful reason I have NOTHING lined up for me, would the best case scenario be to go ahead and just apply for adjustment of status?

As suggested by the topic, I completed a JD degree (doctorate, in terms of OPT level) two years ago, but I returned to my country right after graduation and did not apply for OPT.

Now I just got accepted to an LLM (Master) program, and was wondering if I will be eligible for my LLM opt, or can I even reclaim my JD OPT after the LLM one?

The reason I ask it this way is that one of my friends was considering pursuing a master's degree after his PhD as well, but he already used his PhD OPT, and he said that the rule is that you can't go ""down"" regarding the level of degree. And I don't know if my situation differs from his since I never used my JD OPT.

In short, my question has two parts:

(1) Will I be eligible for OPT in general? (considering the rules about going down)

(2) If I am, can I also reclaim the previously unused JD OPT after the expiration of my LLM OPT?"
t3_yat4uq,6,German looking to study in the US - what are my chances to actually get an F1? Looking for honest advice.,2022-10-22 17:12:21,"Hi, I'm a 22 year old German citizen (born and raised, never been anywhere else) currently in the process of getting an F1 visa for the spring 2023 term. I was wondering what my actual chances to get a visa were and I thought I'd ask you guys for your opinion.

I have a concrete plan of what I wanna do. The original plan was to go to a college to pursue a bachelors in a video game production adjacent course. I couldn't attend that college because upon translating my HS certificates I learned that my GPA wasn't good enough. (3.2 GPA needed, I had a 3.18 GPA 🤦) So instead I applied to a close-by community college, which was recommended to me by a friend and also has a very good relationship with the other college so transfer won't be a problem. I'm planning to attend this community college to get an associates degree in liberal arts, which I will then use to transfer to the previously mentioned college to pursue the bachelors degree, as I originally intended. After that I'm planning to go work at a German video game company that I've wanted to work at ever since I was 12 years old. I know I'll already have a tougher go at my interview considering that I'm going to community college but there's also some other red flags that I'm concerned about.

For example I have a great aunt (my grandpas sister) who is a US citizen. I don't really have any contact with her, nor do I know where she lives or what she's up to, but I'm worried that she will be a problem for me nonetheless and that the officer will think that there's intent to stay in the US due to her. (there isn't)

Another red flag is that there's a two year gap between me graduating from high school and starting my first real job. After HS I became very sick for a pretty long time and couldn't work, but with my parents help and support I was able to recover. Right as I was ready to enter the job market, COVID hit so I had to wait another 6 months to get a job. I've had that job for more than 2 years now and I've been saving up a ton to make this dream of studying in the US a reality.

I'm super scared that I will be denied, because this really would be fulfilling one of my biggest dreams, I've wanted to go study in the US ever since I taught myself how to speak English by watching dumb early 2000s high school and college comedy movies.

What can I expect? What should I be prepared for? Any advice is appreciated. Thanks in advance."
t3_yatbtk,6,Do the AP agencies care about the deadline?,2022-10-22 17:20:24,"I applied to F1 visa for my Phd program(STEM) into one of the top schools in my field. I was put into more than 90 days ago. The officer asked me to fill the ds 5535 form and send some documents related to my research. I sent all the required documents and letters from my advisor, the department and the graduate program director indicating the nature of my research and that it is not sensitive. I did not receive  any reply from the embassy and missed my first semester. Now I'm about to miss my second semester and probably my whole fellowship. I tried to email the embassy multiple times indicating the urgency of my deadline but they did not reply. 
The question here is that is there any hope that they actually care about the deadline and I might receive some reply? Do they give any priority to researchers or student visas?  Or they do not care about visa applicant losing his fellowship?

Sorry for the long post but I am extremely anxious and stressed and did not imagine that getting the visa would be this difficult. I come from a middle eastern country with a muslim name(That's why I feel I have been put into this AP thing)"

Just looking more for opinions than anything else as I know no one will really know for sure the answer. My boyfriend went home to South Africa to renew his visa in June of this year. He initially was approved for an interview waiver but when he sent off his documents they sent back a paper telling him he must come in person for an interview. He had his first interview around July 27th and was refused under 214(b). However, he did have sufficient evidence showing his intent to return to his home country and showed no immigrant intent. He consulted with his lawyer and a company called argo and then had another visa interview on August 23rd where he was then put into administrative processing under 221(g). It is now October 23rd, 2 months later, and he has still heard nothing. He had to completely miss the fall semester for school and is really hoping to be back for the spring. I’m just wondering what you guys may think might be going on or how long it seems is may take? I’m getting kind of worried that it’s taking so long but at the same time, surely they wouldn’t take this long to look into it just to deny him? Is there anything he could do to maybe look into it or get an update?

Edit: He is currently in school studying business, just to give more specifics."

So I am on F1 visa here in the US. Until recently there was not a single problem with visa and I20 and passport. 

But recently I decided to change the spelling of my name for personal reasons. So I made the change on my passport (received a new passport). 

But the spelling change is so miniscule: if my name was ""SUNG KOOK"", it is now ""SUNGKOOK"". I just got rid of a single space. 

However my F1 visa (which is on my old passport) has the old spelling which technically does not match my new spelling identically.

The email from the school in which my I20 was attached to states that I need to book any appointment with my city's US embassy to apply for an F1 visa but I've been getting mixed answers on their website. I emailed my school's representative asking whether or not I need to get an appointment with the consulate or if I'd just get granted the F1 visa upon entry to the US if I'm coming from Canada and she told me that I need to book an appoinment. 

I went ahead and applied for a DS160 and have paid the $160 CAD fee for that as well. I've been having difficulty booking an appointment with the embassy but I finally got ahold of someone yesterday saying that I'm not eligible for an appointment yet and that I need to ship out my visa applications first and only then they would decide whether or not I'd be needing one.

So now I have shipped my passport together with my application yesterday. The embassy agent told me that it takes 4-6 weeks to process it, but I have an upcoming emergency overseas trip in 3 weeks that I have booked before even receiving my I20. 

I have read in some forums that Canadian students get the F1 visa at the border when they cross and that they don't need to apply for a DS160 nor need to set up an appointment to obtain the visa. Has anyone gone through this process before? Can you share your experience?"

I didn't put any sponsors on my I-20 nor my DS160 as I'm going to primarily pay for everything myself with funds I saved up over two years of working. I do have two sponsors though, my dad and my grandpa. I was planning to bring up my dad and grandpa sponsoring me in the interview, but now that thats not happening (at least for now) what documents should I provide in order to make it clear that they will be sponsoring me as well?

I prove that I can cover the amount on my I-20 just fine, but its only about 5k over the amount. I want to make sure that there's no doubt in the officers mind that I will be able to pay for everything (because I can).

Should I make my dad sign an affidavit of support? If yes, which one? What's the difference between the I-134 and the I-864? Could my dad draft up his own document saying that he'll support me? What other documents would I need? I can provide bank statements, no problem. Would that be enough?

My understanding is that you're expected to pay taxes on the value of any items you receive, and Amazon will report to the IRS (I think with a form 1099-MISC) if you receive more than $600 of goods in a  year. This doesn't seem like 'employment' in the everyday sense of the term, but I'm still wondering about the legal landscape here if you don't have full work authorization. Would it count as employment purely because I would be receiving goods in exchange for the 'service' of providing a review?

t3_yhm9x5,12,Self Employment during OPT,2022-10-30 18:39:40,"I completed my PhD this summer and applied for post-completion OPT in my grace period. My 90 days unemployment clock has just started (EAD approved recently). I am considering going the self-employment route but my guess is that if I am not getting a job, I probably won't be getting business either.

Everything I read on self-employment on OPT says that

(i) I need the proper business licenses and
(ii) I must be able to prove that I am actively engaged in the business.
(It also needs to be full-time in this case and of course it must be related to my degree as usual.)

Without clients, I can invest in improving my portfolio but there is not much I can do otherwise. Can anyone comment on how I can show I am ""actively engaged in the business""? I am sure it wouldn't cause any problems in the short term but I heard lots of horror stories about people having all sorts of issues at the citizenship stage down the road about anything that might look sketchy. I just want to do everything by the book.

I would appreciate any suggestions!"

t3_yil6sr,1,Used AVR in Canada but CBP officer said she “suggested I get a new visa”?,2022-10-31 18:56:16,"I have a valid I-20 but expired F1 visa. I haven’t been back to my country since 2017 (got the visa for my undergrad and currently doing a PhD) due to how expensive it is + my research doesn’t really allow for me to travel for the extended period of time needed to get my passport back after the interview + my mother and younger brother immigrated (illegally, but they now have green cards) after I do, so I’m concerned that I do not have enough proof of ties.

Anyway, I went to Canada for a few days. I was able to use automatic visa revalidation to get back, but the process was like pulling teeth. The first officer asked the normal questions like where I live, what’s my status, how long / why was I in Canada, etc. But I got sent to the secondary check to “validate my status”. The second officer asked me to show her my expired F1 visa, then asked why I didn’t apply for a new one. So I said that I hadn’t been able to visit my home country yet. After a while she let me through but said that she “suggested I get a new visa.”

I’m confused about what might have happened.

1. Is there a commonly accepted length of time that you can stay with your F1 expired (even if you still have a valid I20)? 

2. I was planning to visit my home country this summer since I might get a fellowship to conduct research there and was planning to apply for a new visa then, but in the case I don’t get a fellowship should I still try to go? If I don’t would it be seen as me disregarding the CBP’s advice in the future? 

3. I was hoping to travel to Mexico / Canada in the future before i renew my visa, I know I’ll probably be marked for secondary check again but would having an expired visa the next time affect my ability to come back? 

Thank you in advance for your help! I learned about ARV recently and was really excited that I can still travel without a valid visa, but this experience made me really question that :("

t3_yl7nf7,7,How does pre-completion OPT work?,2022-11-03 16:44:13,"I am looking to apply for pre-OPT for 3 months (May - Aug 2023) in my Junior year. I have no choice as my school does not allow CPT to be taken more than once. Given that I’m in a STEM major (undegrad), I’ll have 36 months to start off with.

1. During my graduation in Dec 2023, does it mean I’ll have 33 months left for OPT? Or does the OPT timer of 36 months start from May 2023? 

2. Is there any downside to taking pre-OPT compared to CPT? The only serious complication I can think of now (with my limited h1b/h1b1/opt knowledge) is that I get lesser OPT time for full time job. 3 months out of the original 36 months doesn’t seem like that big of a deal as I have H-1b1 visa to fall back on and it seems relatively easy to obtain as a Singapore citizen. 

3. Given how F1 students have 90 days to find a job on OPT after graduation, will taking up pre-OPT affect this in any way (e.g 90 days be reduced to X days)?

Thank you in advance for any advices."

t3_yllraf,3,Full-time CPT vs Pre Completion OPT,2022-11-04 01:58:59,"I am currently on track to graduate by May 2023 for my bachelor's degree. This Fall 2022 semester, I am a full-time student but the next semester (Spring 2023), which will be my last semester, I will be enrolled in only two classes (6 credits), and therefore, will be a part-time student.

  
I have not utilized any of my CPT thus far and was looking to get a full-time CPT during the next semester, Spring 2023. 

  
Due to this situation of mine, I have some questions that I am looking to clarify:

1. Since I will be a part-time student next semester (Spring 2023), which will also be my last semester, is it possible that I can get a full-time CPT? \[My advisor says no but My cousin was in a similar situation last semester during his master's in a different school and got a full-time CPT during his last semester. He was NOT a full-time student during his last semester.\]
2. I was also looking into Pre-completion OPT but from my understanding, it is part-time. Which one would be better in my case: applying for full-time CPT or Pre-completion OPT?
3. This leads to another question. Since I am looking to work full-time next semester, would I be able to work full-time under pre-completion OPT since I would be a part-time and not a full-time student?"

I already asked my DSO and they said that USCIS does not specifify anywhere. They said they will still recommend me for OPT and issue my OPT I-20, but it's up to USCIS to approve it or not. I wonder if anyone out there has had a similar situation and been approved (or rejected...)

My decision will be based on opportunities upon graduation. Australian tuition being half of those from the US, while Switzerland is very very very cheap. However, most of jobs are limited to australian citizen even though they offer a post-study visa for 3 years. 

What was your experience in job hunting on OPT visa ? Was it difficult ? The condition about maximum 90 days of unemployment is stressing me.

This master is qualified for STEM OPT. I heard you have more chances to land a job with a STEM major.

Definitely looking forward to hearing your experience.

I just got an offer from a big tech for a software engineering internship in the spring. It's gonna be full-time + in another state so I would have to relocate. It is an extremely amazing opportunity for me, so I reached out to my DSO advisor to ask about full-time CPT application. She said I cannot be given full-time CPT because 1) my internship is not a part of a co-op program (my school is a big state school and it sucks cause there's no co-op available) and 2) I have to be present physically at my school in the spring in order to maintain f1 status so relocating for an on-site internship is impossible.

&amp;#x200B;

I have seen several people do full-time internships during fall/spring before, and I also saw some ways to work around with this. I told my DSO advisor that I would do concurrent enrollment (take 1 online course at my main university and 3 other in person courses at a community college near my work place) so I can maintain full-time student status. (you need 12 credits and max 1 online course for valid f1 status). However, she still does not approve my case and does not give me CPT. Does anyone know how to deal with this situation? I tried asking my recruiter to push my internship to the summer but no luck.

2) will I have to show the financial contribution in form of cash in the bank or my parents' asset documents?
3) if it is cash, should it be in USD or my local currency.

5) can my parents' borrow money from someone else just to get the visa approved? Will the visa officer ask where did the money come from?
6) after getting admission and scholarship, what is the complete procedure of obtaining the visa?

I will be grateful for any kind of help. Thanks 😊"

I am trying to figure out what the reason could be since, according to what I found online, it seems they do this if you have an ineligibility or apparent ineligibility.

I completed a semester abroad on a J1 visa in2021 with a visa that expired in May 2021 (within 24 months).

I recently traveled to the US in September 2022 to visit the university. I am not sure if traveling to the country so recently has had any effect on this decision.

In general, I have traveled quite a few times to the US to visit friends that I met in a high school exchange and in my university J1 exchange. Maybe they think I don't have strong ties to my home country.

Lastly, I realized that I chose ""No"" for the question on the DS160 that asked if I had ever had 10-finger prints done before, although I really should have chosen ""Yes"" since I did for my J1 Visa (I forgot).

Based on this information, does anyone have any ideas why I could have been denied from the waiver? I know there could be a million possible reasons, but I'm wondering if there is any clear reason that can save me some stress. Thanks!"

\- If I apply for STEM-OPT I-20 on Nov 22, and leave the U.S. on Nov 25, will I be able to get the I-20 when I am still outside the country? Should I reach out to the DSO contact (name on I-938) to let him know about my situation and produce the I-20?

\- Is it possible to apply for the EAD when I'm physically outside the U.S? If not, can I apply for it on the Dec 26 without any implications?

\- On my university website, it says I need to apply to the USCIS within 60 days from the date of the new I-20. Is that correct?

Worst case scenario is that I can't have I-20 granted by Dec 25, and will have to wait for Jan 2 to apply for that, which means I may push the deadline of my EAD a bit. While I think there's still time, I'm pretty nervous about this because if there's any error from the DSO, it would leave me no room to change. If you have been in a similar situation, please share your experience with me. Thanks a lot."

t3_yzelua,4,Did I get 221G?,2022-11-19 15:36:52,"Sorry for the multiple posts, bit I am lost. I applied for an interview waiver for an F1 visa from Germany but apparently did not get the waiver. At the end of last week, I got an email saying ""the consular office requests a personal interview"". However, when I try to schedule an appointment on the website, I get only a blank screen (see photos) although I am almost certain there are appointments available.

When I check my visa status, it says it has been refused (all see photos). However, I never received any 221G document or any other notice other than the one saying they request a personal interview.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone know what the issue might be? I am supposed to start in early Jan, so I am getting worried that if there is the extra processing time, or if I can't schedule my appointment, then I will not be able to attend my program. 

How can I schedule an appointment if the website is broken? If I call the consulate directly, will they be able to schedule it? I am assuming they would just tell me to try the website.

My doubt is that do I need a new SEVIS ID to transfer to the second school if the summer class at my first school ended on September 30th (in other words, my I-20 expired on September 30th)? I know that I need a new I-20 for the second school, but I am not sure if I have to get a new SEVIS ID or pay the SEVIS I-901 fee again.

I have one more year of college, however, here’s the tricky situation. My dad petitioned for immigration and recently got denied, and now I’m really concerned that my change of status could be denied.

My family is currently in the US with E-2 visa but it’s expiring in a few months. What are the odds that officer finds out my family has petitioned for immigration and deny my visa? If I try to COS within the US, will that help my case at all? Since my family is still in the US and got denied for immigration, will my F1 visa not get approved?

I was enrolled in a university in California from 2020-2021 to take online classes due to Covid (I was due to move there in 2020).  Currently out of school, but I plan to continue my studies in California in the fall of 2023, which means I will also be applying for an F1 visa later.  I only plan to stay for about four months with my B1 visa.  Should I tell the immigration officer that I am moving to the US for school or not?  Especially if they ask.  I'm not currently enrolled for the semester, but my name is still on the school records so maybe they'll find out

I am planning to come back first before I apply for F1 visa.

Also more info: since it is a sport training with lessons only 12 hours a week with a coach + exercising by myself on my own time (don’t know if the hours count) i’m pretty sure i don’t qualify for M visa since it technically counts as short term training. 

I plan on being honest as they probably can find my school record anyways and see that i’m taking a gap. But i don’t want them to get the wrong idea so i don’t know how to word it out. I have a company back at home and so i’ll only be there for studies."

I had applied for stem opt on May 2022 and I received an rfe on that stating the E-verify number cannot be validated, but my company had used its parent Company's E-verify number which is allowed and my colleagues also got their EAD approved using the same number.

But recently I got a denial notice stating that USCIS didn’t receive my rfe response which is not true because we have the tracking receipt as well as the signature of the person who received it at the USCIS office. So we are going to file for a motion to appeal (I-290B form). So I wanted to know if I can still work after getting the denial notice till my grace period? or do I need to stop working immediately?

I am planning to visit Canada in around a month. I have checked CBP website and am pretty sure that I am able to use AVR policy to re-enter the US. There are, however, two caveats and I want to make sure about them:

1. I attended high school in the US and transferred my SEVIS to my college. The SEVIS status has been valid throughout (no interruptions!), but my F-1 visa still has my high school name on it. I know it shouldn't be an issue because I used that visa to re-enter the US this March (it expired this June) through Detroit-Windsor with no problems, but I want to double check.
2. I filled out a DS-160 a few months ago. My original plan was to go to Canada and obtain a US visa, but I ultimately dropped that plan. Will that count as ""applied for a US visa"" and invalidate me from AVR policies?

Is this request a two step process ?

I seem to doubt this since hours worked are now zero on my paystubs even though I get full salary.

I have got conflicting advise in this matter from lawyers. Some say garden leave is not unemployment some say it is.

Should I ask my DSO to request a data fix to SEVP portal to reflect my last day of actual work as opposed to severance pay?

Does doing this create a possibility of violation of status since more than 21 days have passed already?"

My international student's office is giving me a lot of trouble for this and claims extending my I-20 would be very hard.

Does anyone here have experience with this? As much as I would like to finish in 4 semesters, paying this much for my education doesn't seem worth it if I can't make the best off it. In case this is relevant, I also have a documented mental illness that I could leverage in the reasoning.

Before that however, I was hoping to do a summer 2023 internship in the US, using CPT authorization.

Does the following sound like it could work out?

1. submit my Leave of Absence form on December 15, 2022, before I leave the US
2. leave the US within 15 days of submitting the above form, let's say the next day, December 16
3. request my school to reactivate my SEVIS record so that I can enroll in a summer ""course"" to be eligible for CPT, for an internship in the US beginning May 24, 2023, this being the start of the summer 2023 CPT duration- This assumes that I return by around May 10, 2023, so that I will not have been outside the US for the five months, beginning December 15, 2022, while also making use of the fact that I should be able to re-enter the US up to 30 days before the start of the school session- I am also assuming that the start of the 2023 summer CPT period aligns with the start of my school's summer session
4. continue with my internship in the US, until August, 2023
5. go back to school in August, 2023, after my internship ends and then graduate in December, 2023
6. use OPT for any full time opportunities in the US, should I wish to do so, soon after graduating

The most iffy part here to me seems to be that reactivating the SEVIS record for a May 24, 2023 internship start date, because:

* I wouldn't be doing a full time course load, since I would be doing a fulltime internship instead
* if I submit the form on December 15, 2022, then it will be more than five months until May 24, 2023, and maybe being back in the US by around May 10, 2023 isn't good enough

I did have a call with my International Students office 1-2 months ago, in which I asked whether I would be able to do a summer internship after coming back from a LoA, and they seemed fine with it.

Today, I made a quick call to the office to verify by when I needed to submit my documents, since I'm flying out soon, and I spoke with a different person this time who said that what I'm trying to do might not work and that I might not be able to be eligible to return until August, 2023, and that additionally, my ""one year"" count for CPT eligibility would be reset. This was a quick call and not as part of an appointment for a deeper discussion.

I have made an appointment to speak with someone from the office tomorrow to re-verify everything, but until then, I was hoping I could get some clarifications here, to help me be prepared for the meeting tomorrow.

Thanks for reading.

t3_zh9iyt,13,What are some common reasons to reject a F1 visa renewal,2022-12-09 21:38:00,"Hey all,

I am a PhD student in computer science, and I am about to finish my 1st semester. Before this, I had a Master's from a different school, and then I worked for 3 years on OPT and STEM OPT, before starting my PhD studies. I F1 visa expired in June 2022, and I am planning to go back to India to get it renewed in May 2023. 

My question is, what are some common reasons for the Visa officer to reject my visa extension? I don't think I have broken any rules to the best of my knowledge (except for when I submitted my 12 month evaluation late to my DSO). Also, how likely is it for F1 visa renewal rejections, compared to first time visa application rejections?

Please note - I am asking about F1 visa extensions, not about first time F1 visa application.

Thanks a bunch!"
t3_zhx8sw,2,Anyone here who renewed F1 visa from India recently?,2022-12-10 16:52:18,"Hey all,

I was wondering if anyone here renewed their F1 visa from India? Specifically, Is there anyone here who went for higher studies after working on STEM OPT for 3 years, and got the visa renewed?

I know that we can continue studying without renewing the visa, but I wanted to go back home to visit family. I was wondering if visa renewal back in India would be a problem, since the VO might see that I finished my master's and worked on OPT and now going for further studies as potential intent to immigrate? I don't know if being in a fully funded PhD program is going to matter in this situation!

Please let me know if anyone here had a similar story here. I freaking out about the possibility of a rejection!

Also, please note, I am asking for F1 visa renewal experiences, not the initial F1 visa applications.

Thanks a bunch!"
t3_zi4s77,32,My school missed their SEVP recertification deadline,2022-12-10 21:54:12,"Well. My school’s DSO did not file the recertification papers on time-was one month late. The school was automatically withdrawn from the system. The deadline was August 1st, the papers were sent end of September. SEVIS was called and they confirmed that the school lost it’s certification due to missing the deadline. The school is working on fixing all that (we are lucky because we have alumnus in high places, that’s what the school is saying).

If i can also mention, the international student (me) was the one that discovered the mistake and reported it to the DSO’s boss. And let me give more details. I’ve been having issues with this DSO (not just me, all international students) since i joined this college, I almost got deported once because she told me that I don’t need my i-20 signed before leaving USA for vacation. Of course I believed her, because it came from the DSO. So, when i was on the port of entry, they took me to the back room and told me to take the first flight and go back home. I was lucky that my coach was able to convince them that the DSO made a mistake. I was able to get in, but since that incident that could have ruined my life, I learned everything there is about immigration. I had to give instructions to the DSO on what to do for my CPT, OPT, STEM OPT (she was always rude of course). The most recent was that my DSO had to report my OPT participation in SEVIS. She was trying to prolong that for a whole month, saying that she is locked out and that she is still waiting on a recertification. For a month!! I looked into it, went to her boss and said that I think that we lost our certification. Many students that went to interviews to get their visas were denied and nobody new why. Well!! 

So, bottom line: the school is working on getting the school back into SEVIS. But they are trying to scare us to not talk about this (only me and my boyfriend knows about this) by telling us that if the school didn’t have it’s certification for 3 months, means that all international students were out of status. They are using their connections to get the school back in the system but by using the story where it wasn’t the schools fault, that someone else was supposed to be notified about the deadline, not just one DSO. And they are telling us that they chose this approach to protect the students, so that we don’t get into trouble for being out of status. 

I mean what the hell, the school messes up, doesn’t even know that this was happening, the international student finds the mistake and they are trying to scare us?? 
None of the students received emails from SEVP or ICE to leave the country in those 3 months (Sep, Oct, Nov). I discovered the issue end of November.

Should we involve an immigration lawyer? What can/should we do in this case? It is definitely not our fault the DSO didn’t do their job and was sitting on it for 3 months, putting our lives in jeopardy every single day, and when confronted kept lying to everyone’s faces.

And as far as we know, the school is apparently back in the system, they are working on registering a new person as the school’ DSO."
t3_zi5c55,3,Worked on campus and researched. Is it allowed?,2022-12-10 22:15:31,"Last summer I worked as a residential assistant on campus in summer. I was working 38-39 hours a week. I think that’s allowed since it was during summer and we didn’t have classes. I never went over 39 hours. 
At the same time I started research with a professor  for my undergrad research scholarship for summer research. I never finished the research but I received $500. It’s basically a scholarship provided to undergrad when they get admitted and they have to use it by the end of sophomore year. This research wasn’t really “official” we just received a $500 scholarship for putting in our “idea” and getting it approved. We didn’t actually work, but we’re supposed to come up with an idea in our own time by a deadline. Met with the professor online for 15 mins once every month. 


Is this okay? I just want to make sure. It was last year and then I submitted my taxes this year and everything is fine so I’m hoping I didn’t mess up?"

I got full funding for an MS program for spring 2023. I applied for Fall 2022 and deferred to Fall 2023 due to a lack of funding. But a Professor contacted me to notify available funding for Spring 2023.

I was not expecting the offer was preparing and giving interviews for my other applications for next year. I asked him for a week to decide on the offer and sort out my finances. Now he is skeptical about whether I can make it. I am at my lowest; it will be a blessing if I can go this January.

On the embassy website, I saw insane wait times; but Kolkata is showing 29 Calender days of expected wait time. I do not know much about the F1 visa process, but I think it is straightforward compared to countries like Canada. Do I stand a chance if I start now? Is there anything I can show the Professor to convince him?

His job was legal, degree was legal and was also a Research assistant at his school.

t3_zjrtxe,6,Potential employer says they can’t give me an official offer until I receive my EAD through OPT.,2022-12-12 07:54:12,"I’m a senior chem student studying at a college in the U.S. I’ve applied to many places for jobs (mostly universities RA positions) and have gotten several offers.

They are willing to wait but not too long.

My question is:
- Is this a bad sign for their institute that they cannot accommodate well for internationals’ visa timeline?
- Given that I have to take some job to stay in the U.S. (which is what I want), and that I most likely lose other offers if I waited till the EAD arrives, should I just accept one of the official offers I have already?

I asked HR about this and they told me that they don't use E-Verify. However, when I look up the company on [e-verify.gov](https://e-verify.gov) there is an entry for the company, so maybe they just don't know?

I do know that the program end date has to be changed before the official program end date that is on the i20. I guess my questions are: 
1.Is there any extra time for that change to be made by the DSO? 
2.What happens if it is not, would they fall out of status?
3.If they fall out of status, can they get back in, since it was the university DSO’s mistake? 

At this point, the frustration is horrible and thinking about involving a lawyer.

t3_zmoz17,2,Trying to confirm that I understand what counts as OPT un/employment from in terms of the various dates involved,2022-12-15 16:14:35,"This is regarding a post-completion OPT.

I graduated December 12th (making Feb 10 the latest date I can request as my OPT start date). I got a job offer from an employer and have asked them to make the start Jan 23rd, which is what I filed for on my OPT request form.

The questions I have are:

1. On the very likely possibility of the EAD not arriving on requested date(Jan 23rd), and says arrives on Feb 06th, would the 14 days between the Jan23rd and Feb 06th count against the 90 days of unemployment? How does the answer to the previous question change if the EAD arrives after Feb 10, the last day of my grace period?

2. I have communicated my circumstances to my employer and they have said the easiest thing for them to do would be to turn the position that was offered to me into an ""on-call"" one within their systems and file zero hours of work done until my employment authorization arrives. The alternative from my employer being re-setting contract, going through background checks and reference checks again (not sure why changing the start date would need such a drastic reset to the job offer/contract but on my end it is more or less take it or leave it). On a student visa this seems a little dicey, legally I can stall paychecks by not working any billable hours until EAD arrives but their is a piece of paper within a company's records that states my start dates were on Jan 23rd. Should I push to avoid this?"

\- She frequently crosses the US-Mexico border by foot or vehicle without any issues. 

\- Traveled for a week to UK from the US. No problem getting there. On the way back she was denied boarding. 

\- According to someone over the phone at DHS, OPT travel endorsement is only valid for traveling to Canada and Mexico. We could not find any source for this.

t3_zmzkgl,1,Leave of Absence / F1 Visa Renewal,2022-12-15 23:17:41,"Hello, I'm originally from Vietnam and have been in the U.S. for about 3 years now on a F1 visa.  My F1 visa expired a while ago, but I am still able to legally stay in the U.S. on my I-20.  I'm about a semester or two away from graduating with an Associates Degree.  I'm currently exploring options to go home for personal reasons during the spring 2023 semester:

1. Annual Vacation -- my school is on a semester system, and I normally do not take classes during the summer semester.  I'm not sure if the summer semester qualifies as my ""Annual Vacation"" and am also not sure if I qualify for the Annual Vacation now since I'm close to graduating.  Is it taking this Annual Vacation common among F1 students to go back to their home country?

2. F1-Visa Renewal -- I understand that I need to apply at the U.S. consulate back at my home country to renew my F1 visa.   I'm concerned about the risk that my f1 visa might not get renewed, which would prevent me from going back to the U.S. to finish my degree.  Would it be possible for me to ask my family back home to submit the f1 renewal application packet to the local consulate while I'm still in the U.S.? I thought I read that certain renewals do not require an in-person interview.  if an interview is actually scheduled, I would then plan to fly home to attend the interview.  If instead my renewal application is denied, then I would simply continue to stay in the U.S. so that I can finish school.  Would this work?

3. Leave of Absence -- I understand that this is an option that will require me to terminate my I-20 and go through the process of renewing it upon my return.  I guess the only question that I have about this is whether it's common for f1 students to use this option to temporarily go back home?"

t3_zr8pma,1,"Employer wants me to go from F1 to GC without leaving US, possible?",2022-12-21 03:14:04,"Hi folks, I am currently on Year 1 of my STEM OPT Extension. My employer has agreed to sponsor my green card via L1A and then EB1(C). I am a senior executive and meet the requirements of L1A &amp; EB1(C) as confirmed by my company's immigration lawyers. 

However, my company really wants to avoid having me leave the US for a 1 year and basically is asking me if it's possible to move directly from current F1 to L1A or EB1(C). My lawyers have said its not possible and I need to leave the country for a year. My company would reeaaally like me to continue living in the US for the entire GC process since they want to avoid disruption that my absence from the US for a year might cause. 

I have heard just random bits of news that it *might* be possible to move directly from F1 to green card without leaving the US. So I am reaching out here to see if there is any truth to that, if any one can point me to a definite source on this, it would be really, really appreciated very much! Thank you!!"
t3_zrbdf2,0,Discrepancy in H1B record. forgot to report I-983,2022-12-21 05:26:33,"Last year I was on Stem OPT and worked with Company A for 3 weeks. That company didn't sponsor H1-B, so my payroll was moved to another agency (let's call it Company B), but the client was the same. The problem is that I forgot to submit I-983 for company A to DSO/USCIS. Later on, when Company B was filing my H1-B, I didn't report employment with company A as there was no I-983 submitted for that.


When it came to filing my Tax return for 2021, I reported my income from Company A, because they generated a W2 and I didn't want to misrepresent my income.

Now there's a discrepancy in my record due to my own mistake of forgetting to report I-983 at the time for Company A.


As time passed, I had forgotten about it. However, recently, I have gotten an offer from another company, and it brought back this mistake to the fore. It might come up during a background check. Also, they will have to file a Change of Employer petition for H1-B, and I am unsure whether I should report employment with company A, considering it wasn't reported during the initial H1-B filing and is not in my SEVP record.


I'm concerned that it will be an issue for me if I change an employer, or file for a green card later.


I realize that this is my own mistake but I'm not sure what my options are at this point. The new employer wants to start the Change of Employer (COE) petition as soon as possible.


I would be very grateful for any advice on how to tackle this situation."

I have an expired J1 Visa with valid I94 and DS-2019 forms. I know this is the subreddit for f1visa but the J1 Visa seems like a similar process.

Does anyone have experience coming back from a Carnival Cruise using automatic revalidation? My DSO has confirmed that I can travel to these areas and come back on automatic revalidation. However, all attempts to contact Carnival have been met with confusion and the representatives seemed to have no idea what I was talking about. That leaves me pretty concerned.

I only have class on Fridays this coming semester, so I'm thinking of taking the day off work so I can go to class too.

Will there be issues if I am only in the US on Friday and the weekends but back in Canada Monday - Thursday? I do not plan on working while in the US because I would not be authorized to do so, however, as a Canadian citizen, I do have authorization to work while within Canada.

My school is in California so it is not close to the Canadian border, meaning I wouldn't be the usual commuter student. I saw a similar question [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/f1visa/comments/tymi8e/comment/i3wcu8y/), but that didn't touch on commuting back and forth between Canada and the US."

1. My friend has a brother in the same city as his school.
2. My friend has proof of sufficient funds and admission to his University.
3. Classes start this Spring (2023).
4. The consular who interviewed him had denied several people that day.
5. Here is how the conversation went

Consular: why did you pick University XXX and how are you paying it?

Friend: University XXX ticked my criteria for the program I was interested in and my brother lives in the same city as the University. Do you need to see my proof of funds?

Consular: That won't be necessary, you are ineligible for the visa?

WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK?!?!?! The US Consulate in Nigeria has consular that are notorious for denying numerous people.

Were there any red flags?

He just contacted University XXX today and is in the process of rescheduling. Is there anything that we can do to strengthen our case?

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT #1

Additional Info:

He has 2 siblings, both went to University in the US and one returned immediately after graduation, his brother who lives in the city got a job on OPT, and now has GC through his wife. Has never been out of status or committed any crimes.

Also, the rest of his nuclear family is in Nigeria and they visit the US very frequently (at least once a year for over a decade). He did his Bachelor's outside Nigeria and even started a Masters's in Ukraine and had to leave because of the war.

He has a history of returning to Nigeria, is there a way to emphasize this before they make a decision?"

I scheduled another interview for next week so I desperately need some help/advice.

I think they rejected me because my brother who lives in USA is my ""strong ties to USA"". The visa office was very interested in why my brother didn't visit home back home even once since entering USA on F1 in 2015. In reality he didn't visit because he was doing classes during vacations, looking for jobs, and then after graduating in June 2018 he worked on OPT, then the pandemic hit, and then he got his H1B in 2021 (so he couldn't travel due to work). They didn't even give me a chance to prove (or question me on) strong ties overseas. I was planning to prove it by showing that I own a business (my father is the managing director of the business as shown in the trade license but he is about to retire in a few years).

**Question 1)** How much info can the visa officer see about my brother on their computer during the interview? Can they see his date of entry into USA, graduation date, OPT start date, STEM OPT start date, and H1B start date? H1B RFEs? If he applied for EB3 green card can they see it on their screen? Do they see if he actually travelled overseas during his stay or not? Or do they rely on the F1 candidate to answer that? What are all the info they can see about him?

**Question 2)** Is the business ownership a good proof of ""strong ties overseas""?

**Question 3)** Will lawyers be able to advise me better on the F1 interview?"

I'm currently in the middle of my Bachelor's degree and I applied for an F-1 visa renewal because mine expires in 6 months and I did not want it to expire. I was eligible for a dropbox so here's my timeline

9th Dec -&gt; Dropped off documents via Dropbox in Mumbai, India consulate.

13th Dec -&gt; Status updated to refusal on the application.

16th Dec -&gt; Received my passport and a white 221(g) slip saying I need to appear for an interview but no date was given.  Sent an email to the consulate email asking when should I interview.

17th Dec -&gt; Public response received to the email saying anyone with 221(g) refusal with an interview request can come in anytime between 10:30am-11 am any weekday. It is necessary for you to receive this email or have it written on the slip to avail this option.

Dec 19th -&gt; Went into the Mumbai consulate for the interview. I did not have a printout of the email received so security at the beginning cross-checked with the embassy if I did receive the email or not. They confirmed I did since it was tied to my passport. The process of cross-checking took extra 20-25 minutes though. Interviewer approved. The status also changed to approve

Dec 20th -&gt; Application Status changed to Issued

Dec 22nd -&gt; Passport received with the new visa

\------------- Interview conversation with the VO ---------------

Since I am a 221g case, they wanted my fingerprints first and then went to the interview line. Isn't valid for all 221(g) cases though.

Me: Good morning officer, how are you doing?

VO: Great. Pass me your passport, the 221(g) slip and I-20

Me: \*Passes the documents\*

VO: So you go to Drexel university?

Me: Yes officer.

VO: Don't you like Philadelphia?

Me: No I really like it, it's the city of brotherly love.

VO: \*Looks at the screen\* So your major is Business Analytics?

Me: No officer it's xxx, I changed my major in my freshmen year

VO: You have a visa which is valid up until your graduation date why do you want to renew it?

Me: I plan on taking OPT and I want to frequently visit my family so I want to renew my visa.

VO: When is your graduation date?

Me: Told

VO: \*Still unsure why I want to renew\* Give me 2 minutes \*Goes in the back to cross-check with someone else\*

VO: Comes back and says I have cancelled your current visa and approved the new one. You should be getting it in a week.

Today I emailed my school and the DSO said that my sevis status is still showed as requesting even though my opt was already approved. (The annoying thing is that the international student office is closed until my start date) 

Is it the school’s job to update my Sevis record or the government? Will I get in any trouble if I start working on Jan 3rd?"

How long will I have to wait until I get it shipped?,2022-12-29 00:25:01,"Last week I went to renew my visa and it got approved (yay!) and now I have to wait for them to ship it to a DHL office. My question is, how long will it take for them to ship back my passport with the visa stamped?

Will this status change there too?

t3_zxwwew,2,International Medical Under Graduate,2022-12-29 05:28:46,"""...XYZ hospital can only accept a F1 Visa, but this will be subject to approval by our immigration team. XYZ hospital is NOT eligible to sponsor student visas.""

Hello,
I am an International Medical Student from India currently pursuing by MBBS degree. To gain a medical license in the US, we have to gain 3-4 months of Clinical Experience which is often referred to as the USCE. USCE is an unpaid shadowing opportunity for medical studemts abroad to gain insight about the US health-care. Most for-profit USCE providers sponsor a B1 visa. Unfortunately, I am highly interested in applying to XYZ hospital, and they only accept F1 visas (excerpt from mail attached above). From what I understand, F1 visas can only be sponsored by educational institutions for full time students, for which I believe I am not eligible? The reason I'd prefer F1 visa over B1 is because I plan to do USCE for 7-8 months. My questions are:
-Is there a way I can get F1 visa maybe by requesting XYZ hospital?
-If F1 visa is sponsored by XYZ hospital, am I allowed to do USCE at other hospitals too?
-If B1/B2 visa can be provided merely by showing Letter of Acceptance at XYZ hospital?
-If B1/B2 visa is sponsored, can I extend it for an additional 6 months or I have to exit and reapply?
Please excuse me for any errors, this is the best I have understood so far about US visas."

t3_zyc2ln,2,F1 Visa Renewal - ignore Proof of SEVIS Payment requirement for dropbox?,2022-12-29 18:14:42,I am on STEM OPT and have a drop box appointment for F1 renewal. One of the required documents listed on dropbox confirmation letter is  Proof of SEVIS Payment. This makes sense for new F1 applications but I don't think I need to pay the SEVIS fee again correct? There was no break in my education and I have graduated 2 years ago and have a valid and active SEVIS record.
t3_zyc7pf,12,Requesting Help with unbelievably convoluted F-1 OPT situation,2022-12-29 18:20:15,"I'm looking for any advice at all in my current situation so let me break it down as cleanly as possible:

1. **Currently on F-1 student visa OPT first-year work authorization after my undergraduate course completion** 
2. Eligible for STEM OPT extension and submits/applies for the same right when eligible (90 days before current 1 year OPT expires). 
3. Informed that my current company will lay me off :( 
4. But STEM OPT extension application approved during my layoff ""notice"" period - my university tells me I can move to another company and simply update employment because I'm on OPT
5. **Gets approved for STEM OPT extension and new EAD card mailed out :)** 
6. But USCIS inexplicably sends my new EAD card to my old address (used for my first-year OPT EAD card) even though my I-765 application form has the right mailing address - apparently it doesn't matter what you put on the form because you need to put in a separate ""change of address request""? Not sure if this only impacts online filers.... seems extremely unreasonable....
7. I find a friend who lives near my old address and I get them to check - the mail is not there even though USCIS/USPS tracking says it's delivered :( Unable to get in touch with the people who currently live at my old address so it has become virtually impossible to track this mail with my new EAD card at all 
8. Have been trying for the past month to work with USCIS and USPS to somehow find this mail and just get some help but they have been absolutely useless - truly seems that they couldn't care less if I get deported or something else 
9. **I have got a new job offer at a new company (yay!) but now I am in a situation where my first-year F-1 OPT expires shortly after I am supposed to start at the new place and I don't have my STEM extension EAD in hand to continue working after that :(** 

I am at my wits ends because I have only hit dead ends - can't contact the tenants at my old place even through the leasing agency because of ""privacy concerns"", reached out to the local police even but they say they can't help with recovering mail from a personal residence, USPS simply says their hands are clean because it's delivered (even though the mail is apparently lost even at my old address), USCIS doesn't give a single fuck and their customer support has pretty much rolled their eyes at me (they aren't even willing to tell me the status of the ""official address change"" I put in a month ago, without which I can't even reapply). 

**Anyways, the options I see in front of me now are:**

1. Initiate a non-delivery issue case with USCIS for my EAD: problem here is they say to wait 90 days after applying to open this case.... You can only apply for the extension 90 days before the expiry of your first-year OPT.... I am being asked to wait for my work authorization to expire effectively....
2. Reapply all together with a new I-765: direct problem here is the address change as mentioned above, further potential problem past that is that the I-983 and other form formalities I completed with my old company might not be valid because I am now ""terminated"" and I haven't yet started at my new company so I'm not sure if they can process this stuff for me (any advice regarding this option would be super helpful) 
3. Somehow retrieve the mailed EAD card: this is what I have been attempting so far as mentioned, but the universe is literally only showing me closed doors :( 

**Please let me know of any other options I have but have not listed above - I will try any opportunity to get my work authorization situation back to normalcy.** 

Again, I am in such a messed up situation because I was able to get over the big life-shaking lay off and somehow bounce back but now I might not have the work authorization to work at all which might cost me my new job and more..... Not sure what to do because I am so uniquely fucked with the combination of presently unemployed, wrong address used by USCIS, current OPT expiry incoming, etc. all coming together ridiculously. 

**Please feel free to ask as many details as you need, but if this subreddit could push me even an inch in the direction of a working solution to this situation, I would be immensely grateful.** 

Thank you so much in advance"
t3_zyfb1b,7,F1 OPT - 90 days of Unemployment,2022-12-29 20:20:06,"I  have recently secured a job in the USA.

t3_zygjqc,0,Question regarding employer name difference on I983/STEM OPT I20&amp; I765 application,2022-12-29 21:10:02,"Hi all, 
Just wondering if anyone has been in my situation before. 

I’m currently on my first year OPT(post completion) and trying to submit application for STEM OPT. on my I-983 which was filled out by company HR department using employer name as ABC which is also on my I-20. But they also told me to use XYZ on I-765 (under Company name listed in E-verify and # section)since ABC is the subsidiary company of XYZ. And they use XYZ E-verify and # to verify all subsidiary company OPT candidates. These two names are completely different. They also told me to not modify the name on I-983/I-20 which will leave the employer name on I-983/I-20 completely different from I-765. 
Would this cause an issue for I-765 application?
Thanks in advance for all insights."

t3_zyyadl,2,Change of degree F1 visa,2022-12-30 11:26:49,"Hi,
I recently started in a PhD program at the same university I came to for a MS degree in 2019. I graduated MS in 2021. Got OPT and had a job for a year in the same place and then started the PhD this summer. Technically I never left the university. 
I have the updated I20 however I haven’t been back to my home country since coming here for MS. (Several reasons- financial, issues with my family etc) 
My MS visa sticker says it expires in 2024. Will I have to update that visa sticker or get a new one? 
Can I do it without going to my home country? Or can I travel to say Canada instead? 

Please advice. Thanks for your time!"

t3_zyz1oy,3,Do I really need to report a new employer on STEM OPT?,2022-12-30 12:09:59,"I have extended my new EAD through STEM OPT. I’m working for this employer for 21 hours/week that also filed for my STEM OPT extension. But I need an additional job to sustain myself. 

Employers at two part time jobs I found (related to my major) refused to fill out the I-983 form because they couldn’t guarantee 20 hours/week every week (the hour changes depending on the season). And I, the rule follower, showed them the form, and had I not, they would have just allowed me to work since they are not even aware of it.

 In the future. I’m just thinking of not telling employers about the I-983 form and just start my employment as long as they’re E-Verified. I mean, does it really matter if I don’t submit the I-983 form? All I’m asking for is a job to live as everyone else; I’m not committing a crime. I know it’s technically illegal, if we follow the rules, but all I need is a chance to make a living.

My question are:

1. Can I refrain from asking employers from filling out the I-983 form?
2. Will the USCIS know? Do they have enough personnel and resource to check every single detail?
4. What kind of problem would it cause, especially with tax?

Please understand that this intention is coming from frustration.

I’d really appreciate your advice! Thanks!"
